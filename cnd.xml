                <p><pb/>Our latest accounts from the West Indies say, <lb/>that no supply from the
                    islands, either of wheat <lb/>or flour, can possibly be obtained from the Ame<lb
                        break="no"/>rican states in consequence of the great bounties <lb/>given by
                    his Most Christian Majesty on these ar<lb break="no"/>ticles. Our charity,
                    therefore, if we have any of <lb/>these articles to spare, must be first
                    extended to <cb/>
                    <lb/>our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised, <lb/>particularly when we
                    consider the present price of <lb/>bread at home, that no assistance can be
                    given at <lb/>present, either to the French or Dutch.</p>
                <p>The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a <lb/>most plentiful harvest, except
                    to the eastward, <lb/>which ahs generally been considered as the most
                    <lb/>productive part.</p>
                <p>By the Westmoreland, just arrived from Ja<lb break="no"/>maica, we learn that the
                    slaves have become mu<lb break="no"/>tinous to an alarming degree, ever since
                    they were <lb/>made acquainted with the intended abolition of <lb/>the Slave
                    Trade.</p>

                        6.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>"We are dreadfully alarmed at present on ac<lb break="no"/>count of the great
                    scarcity of flour throughout <lb/>the province. Common flour sold this morning
                    <lb/>in the market at six dollars, per cwt. bran from <lb/>7s. 6d. to 6s. oats
                    3s. per bushel, and pease 20d. <lb/>per bushel. There has been an account taken
                    of <lb/>the quantity of flour and wheat in this city, and <lb/>liberties, by
                    order of the Governor and Council, <lb/>and we find there is not more than will
                    serve as <lb/>ten days. They ar much worse off in the district <lb/>of Montreal
                    than we are here: We have sent <lb/>them frequent supplies.</p>
                <p>"Wheat which was found too bad to be ship<lb break="no"/>ped last year at three
                    livres, now sells at two <lb/>dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of
                    <lb/>fifteen hundred pounds by this job.</p>
                <p>"Government, for the relief of the poor, have <lb/>caused to be issued, by the
                    contractor here, rise <lb/>at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dol<lb
                        break="no"/>lar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday <lb/>there was
                    delivered above a hundred pounds worth <lb/>in this way.</p>
                <p>"In consequence of letters by last Thursday's <lb/>post from Montreal, two
                    thousand bushels of da<lb break="no"/>maged wheat were shipped yesterday for
                    that <lb/>market. We have not had a grain of flour from <lb/>England or the
                    States, though we hear of a car<lb break="no"/>go from New York, for Montreal.
                    The vessel <lb/>was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more <lb/>than
                    probably, that people there, being in great <lb/>want themselves, have detained
                    her. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment have done now what they should have
                    <lb/>done five or six months ago, and then we should <lb/>not be in this
                    starving condition ; that is, we are <lb/>to have a proclamation to permit the
                    importation <lb/>of grain and flour from the States.</p>
                <p>"My servant is just come home from the ba<lb break="no"/>ker's, where I had sent
                    him for half a dollar's <lb/>worth of bread. After watching for two hours,
                    <lb/>till the bread came out of the overn, he could get <lb/>but
                    eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves, <lb/>indeed, weighing only two pounds
                    each. Thir<lb break="no"/>ty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit.
                    <lb/>The Lord knows what will become of us&#x2013;ex<lb break="no"/>cept
                    Government will distribute some of the <lb/>flour that is come for the troops,
                    in the Queen.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Davidson, one of the Council, assured us <lb/>on Thursday last, there was
                    not wheat and flour</p>
                <p><pb/>in the country for five weeks. He has taken a <lb/>great deal of pains to be
                    well informed on the sub<lb break="no"/>juct; and to him are we indebted for the
                        procla<lb break="no"/>mation to allow the importation from the States.
                    <lb/>He stood forth alone, and offered, at his own <lb/>expence, to get an
                    account taken of the quanti<lb break="no"/>ties of wheat and flour in the town
                    and liberties <lb/>of Quebec, and insisted on its being taken into
                    <lb/>consideration."</p>

                <p>"By Captain Gilbert, the bearer of this <lb/>you will learn our distress for want
                    of provi- <lb/>sions: There has not been in the whole island <lb/>one bushel of
                    corn for sale for 16 days past. <lb/>Capt. George, from Baltimore, brought in
                    [?] <lb/>days ago two bushels of corn, which sold immed<lb break="no"/>diately
                    at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in <lb/>360 barrels of flour, common and
                    superfine, which <lb/>sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No ves<lb
                        break="no"/>sel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. <lb/>George;
                    and no vessel belonging to the island is <lb/>expected to relieve us. A great
                    number of poor <lb/>people have been for ten days past obliged to live <lb/>on
                    the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton, <lb/>by advice of his counsel, has
                    opened the port of <lb/>Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever, for thirty
                    <lb/>days, to be computed from the 30th day of March, <lb/>laden with bread,
                    corn; or flour. He also allows, <lb/>for three months, the importation of salted
                        pro<lb break="no"/>visions from any foreign port whatever, in vessels
                    <lb/>belonging to these islands. IT is said, what if any <lb/>foreign vessel
                    should come here after the time per<lb break="no"/>mited by proclamation, they
                    will be allowed to <lb/>dispose of their cargo, if they can prove they set
                    <lb/>out with an intent to come here. If any vessels <lb/>be ready to sail from
                    Norfolk, with provisions, ad<lb break="no"/>vise them to call at Bermuda."</p>

                <p><pb/>THE following extract from a late publica<lb break="no"/>tion, entitled, " A
                    State of the present <lb/>Government of the Province of Quebec," will <lb/>give
                    the public some idea of the Canada Bill, <lb/>which has been so much talked of
                    an procrasti<lb break="no"/>nated so long, and at present pending in Parlia<lb
                        break="no"/>ment. The work we understand to be the pro<lb break="no"
                    />duction of Adam Lymburner, Esq; set over by <lb/>the province to negotiate
                    this afair. It is re<lb break="no"/>markable,withhis former publication, for its
                    strong <lb/>nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.</p>
                <p>"Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all <lb/>mankind. The security which
                    flows from a free <lb/>constitution, to both political and civil liberty,
                    <lb/>contributes greatly towards bringing forth the <lb/>powers of the human
                    mind, and the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of the industry of people ; but no
                        con<lb break="no"/>stitution can be called free where the people are
                    <lb/>not allowed to participate of the legislative au<lb break="no"/>thority by
                    their representatives : This is the great <lb/>criterion of freedom; and it is
                    extremely natural <lb/>for all British subjects, as they know the value of
                    <lb/>it, to struggle for such a valuable right. Great <lb/>Britain has
                    constantly acknoledged this prin<lb break="no"/><cb/>
                    <lb/>ciple in the constitution she has granted to all her <lb/>Colonies; and by
                    that means has rendered them <lb/>more flourishing and prosperous than those of
                        o<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ther nations. Although the inhabitants of the <lb/>province of Quebec have,
                    from the general ten<lb break="no"/>dency of the British government to a mild
                        admi<lb break="no"/>nistration, enjoyed a certain degree of civil liber<lb
                        break="no"/>ty; yet they have been, from the peculiar nature <lb/>of the
                    system of their government, entirely de<lb break="no"/>prived of all political
                    liberty. A more full enjoy<lb break="no"/>ment of these essential privileges has
                    been the <lb/>prayer of their petitions, and of those now be<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>fore the House of commons. The objects prayed <lb/>for may be reduced to
                    the following heads:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"1. An elective house of assembly or repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the
                    people. 2. That the members <lb/>of the legislative council receive no salaries
                    as <lb/>counsellors. 3. That the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>act, and
                    <lb/>the other laws of England relating to personal <lb/>liberty,be made a part
                    of the constitution. 4. That <lb/>trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made
                    part <lb/>of the constitution, and that nine out of twelve <lb/>may return a
                    verdict. 5. That the ancient laws <lb/>and customs of Canada, relative to landed
                        pro<lb break="no"/>perty, marriage settlements, inheritance, and
                    <lb/>dowers, be continued in force in the districts or</p>

                <p><pb n="3"/><hi rend="italic">Curious Anecdote</hi>.&#x2013;A few days ago a
                    stranger <lb/>waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of the East <lb/>India Company,
                    and desired to speak to him in <lb/>private ; when the were retired, the
                    stranger <lb/>said to Mr. Sibbly, " I am lately returned from <lb/>India, I have
                    smuggled goods to the amount of <lb/>about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon
                    <lb/>them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, <lb/>"That he could receive no such
                    money without <lb/>the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said <lb/>the
                    stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possi<lb break="no"/>ble. I am resolved
                    to pay whatever the duty is. <lb/>The Company pays for the exclusive privilege
                    <lb/>of bringing India goods to Europe; the man <lb/>that deprives them of any
                    part of the advantages <lb/>they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion,
                    <lb/>look upon himself as a strictly honest man." <lb/>Since the stranger waited
                    on Mr. Sibbly, the <lb/>Chairman had not had time to give him an an<lb
                        break="no"/>swer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a <lb/>letter,
                    including a Bank note of 30l. The sum <lb/>Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if
                    he paid <lb/>any thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to <lb/>Decca, and arrived there after a
                    passage of 16 <lb/>days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, <lb/>and it was
                    really a shocking sight to behold; <lb/>you could not move out of your house but
                    the <lb/>corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and <lb/>jackalls were
                    eating them at noon-day. The <lb/>Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them
                    <lb/>to ashes, if they can afford it ; if not, throw <lb/>them into the river. I
                    have lately seen a man <lb/>brought to the river side, and laid down at low<lb
                        break="no"/>water mark before he was dead ; and when the <lb/>the tide
                    flowed, it carried him off. If a man, wo<lb break="no"/>man, or child, dies at
                    night, the corpse is eaten <lb/>by the morning. This I have been an eye wit<lb
                        break="no"/>ness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback <lb/>every
                    morning, I had an opportunity of seeing <lb/>more than those that did not. In
                    the course of <lb/>six months I became so much used to it, that I <lb/>took no
                    notice of it.</p>
                <p>"I was there when a dreadful conflagration <lb/>took place, and burnt upwards of
                    seven miles with<lb break="no"/>out intermission, and many souls perished. Now
                    <lb/>consider, first, an inudation; second, a famine; <lb/>and third, a
                    conflagration. How much the place <lb/>must be distressed, I leave you to think.
                    I left <lb/>Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at <lb/>Calcutta, after
                    a passage through the Sunderburns <lb/>(in 17 days), hearty and well, thank
                    God."</p>

                <p><pb n="2"/> The old system of sending men of rank to go<lb break="no"/>vern
                    Jamaica, seems to be revived, and laudably <lb/>too.</p>
                <p>This island is the most important possession we <lb/>hold in the West Indies, and
                    is well entitled to <lb/>any mark of distinction which the parent country
                    <lb/>can bestow upon it.</p>
                <p>The salary and emoluments annexed to the <lb/>government of Jamaica, render it
                    the most valua<lb break="no"/>ble of any in the King's gift, except that of
                        Ire<lb break="no"/>land.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Restoration, O'Brian, third <lb/>Earl of Inchiquin, was appointed
                    Governor of <lb/>Jamaica, and died in his Government.</p>
                <p>Henry Bentinck, first Duke of Portland, was <lb/>made Governor of this island in
                    the reign of <lb/>George I. His Grace died at Spanish Town, <lb/>July 4th, 1736,
                    in the 45th year of his age.</p>
                <p>The death of these two Noblemen in their <lb/>government, gave so bad an
                    impression of the cli<lb break="no"/>mate of Jamaica, and the insalubrity of its
                    air, <lb/>that few persons of rank and fortune have been <lb/>ambitious of
                    becoming governors of it, notwith <lb/>standing the brilliancy of the
                    appointments an <lb/>nexd to the situation.</p>

                    It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform <lb/>our readers, that the United

                    since the beginning of their rebellion, viz. <lb/><hi rend="italic">Vermont,

                        break="no"/>ritory.</p>
                <p>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wil<lb break="no"/>derness; they only
                    began to settle it about the <lb/>year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago lay in
                        fo<lb break="no"/>rest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid <lb/>has
                    been the population, that there are not less <lb/>than one hundred thousand
                    inhabitants, already, <lb/>in each of these states. The State of Indiana
                    <lb/>was only laid off this present year in 1789, and con<lb break="no"/>tains
                    but two or three hundred inhabitants. From <lb/>a description of these four
                    States, published in <lb/>America in May last, we give our readers a <lb/>short
                    abridged description of the last of them, <lb/>called <hi rend="italic">The
                        Western Territory</hi>; and it must re<lb break="no"/>rejoice the heart of
                    every Briton to read it, and <lb/>think, that the settling of these countries,
                    though <lb/>the Americans double their numbers every 15 or <lb/>20 years, will
                    long keep them from manufactur<lb break="no"/>ing, and is every day opening a
                    field for new cus<lb break="no"/>tomers to Great Britain; for who will work as a
                    <lb/>tradesman, even though wages are very high, <lb/>when he can, for twenty
                    pounds, purchase a thou<lb break="no"/>sand acres of land, that being the
                    present price <lb/>fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western
                    <lb/>Territory.&#x2013;Hence the demand of our manufac<lb break="no"/>tures will
                    continually increase with the increasing <lb/>population of
                    America.&#x2013;Desponding politicians <lb/>may derive comfort from the
                    prospect, that new <lb/>channels of commerce will be opened, and the in<lb
                        break="no"/>land parts of the Continent will require an increas<lb
                        break="no"/>ing supply.&#x2013;British manufactures will for ages
                    <lb/>ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by <lb/>means of a most
                    extraordinary inland navigation, <lb/>will be diffused through a country more
                    fertile, <lb/>more extensive, than all the Thirteen United <lb/>States.</p>
                <p><hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">The Western Territory</hi></hi>
                    <lb/>Is the name given to this new State by Congress. <lb/>It is bounded on the
                    west by the Mississippi river <lb/>&#x2013;north by the Lakes&#x2013;east by
                    Pennsylvania? <lb/>south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains,
                    <lb/>according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General <lb/>to the Congress, 411,000
                    square miles, equal to <lb/>two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres,
                    <lb/>from which he deducts forth-three millions of <lb/>acres for water; there
                    will then remain two hun<lb break="no"/>dred and twenty millions of acres
                    belonging to <lb/>the fed&#x2013;ral government, which is to be sold for
                    <lb/>the discharge of the debt owing to the United <lb/>States. But a very small
                    proportion of these <cb/>
                    <lb/>lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and <lb/>disposed of by
                    Congress*.</p>
                <p>On the lands which have been purchased by <lb/>Congress from the Indians two
                    settlements are <lb/>already commenced&#x2013;one at Marietta, the other <lb/>at
                    Miami.</p>
                <p>This State was only laid out by Congress in <lb/>the end of the year 1787, and
                    already contains <lb/>above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are <lb/>the
                    Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhock<lb break="no"/>ing, Sioto, Miami,
                    Wobash,&amp;c&#x2013;Coal and iron <lb/>mines, and salt pits, abound in this
                    State; the <lb/>soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined, and <lb/>may be
                    reduced to yield plentiful crops with little <lb/>or no labour. It is
                    exceedingly healthy, pleasant, <lb/>and commodious&#x2013;the most fertile spot
                    of earth <lb/>known to the Europeans or Americans&#x2013;exceed<lb break="no"
                    />ing the soil of any of the United States. The <lb/>timber is tall, and in
                    great variety?Streams for <lb/>mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and
                    <lb/>cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably <lb/>not escape before a good
                    part of the country will <lb/>be brought to that degree of cultivation that will
                    <lb/>exhibit all its latent beauties, and fulfill the de<lb break="no"
                    />scription of travellers, who call it the <hi rend="italic">garden of</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">the world.</hi> It is here probably also that the center
                    <lb/>of a great empire will be fixed in some future pe<lb break="no"/>riod. It
                    is the most centrical place for Congress <lb/>to accommodate themselves at. No
                    country is <lb/>better stocked with wild game of every kind; <lb/>herds of
                    deers, elks, bears, &amp;c fill the extensive <lb/>meadows of thie
                    country?turkies, geese, swans, <lb/>and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The
                    rivers <lb/>are excellently stored with fish, and almost all na<lb break="no"
                    />vigable for small sloops.</p>
                <p>In the ordinance published by Congress for <lb/>the government of this territory,
                    they are to <lb/>be allowed an Assembly when their number a<lb break="no"
                    />mounts to 30,000 persons; and when they ac<lb break="no"/>quire a certain
                    degree of population they are to <lb/>have representatives in Congress; and when
                    fifty <lb/>millions of acres are settled they are to be divided <lb/>into
                    States.</p>
                <p>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be sup<lb break="no"/>plied with
                    manufactures by you, and you <hi rend="italic">only!</hi></p>
                <p>* No more than about twelve millions of acres have <lb/>yet been purchased of the
                    poor natives, for which Con<lb break="no"/>gress gave them only eight thousand
                    dollars value in goods <lb/>and rum.</p>

                    ready to fall&#x2013; <lb/>attracted the attention, and prepared the mind

                    <lb/>most impetuous wind, darkened the air in such a <lb/>manner, that all
                    surrounding objects seemed lost <lb/>in night. The storm threatened to lay the
                    whole <lb/>town in ruins, with such irresistible force did the <lb/>column of
                    air move on: happily however, the da<lb break="no"/>mages were much less than
                    apprehended. The <lb/> The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Da<lb
                        break="no"/>vidson, being an an elevated spot near the west <lb/>end of the
                    town, and lying directly in the line of <lb/>march of this powerful column, was
                    the first suf<lb break="no"/>ferer; all the parts of the building above the
                    square <lb/>were suddenly borne off, and a great part of the <lb/>roof was
                    carried over Mr. Paton's house, which <lb/>stood at a small distance on the
                    east, striking it <lb/>forcibly, and injuring it greatly in its ways, and
                    <lb/>fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is <lb/>left in much the same
                    condition as the Doctor's. <lb/>After injruing some smaller buildings in its
                    course <lb/>to the eastward, the next elevated object to which <lb/>it pointed
                    its fury, was the presbyterian church <lb/>in the certain of town&#x2013;a
                    building of uncom<lb break="no"/>mon solidity, calculated, it was thought, to
                    stand <lb/>for ages, admist all the war of the elements. A<lb break="no"/>bout a
                    fourth part, however of the roof of the <lb/>north side was carried off, with
                    the weighty cor<lb break="no"/>nice, and thrown to the ground at some hundred
                    <lb/>yards distance on the east side of the open square <lb/>which is in the
                    centre of this borough. After <lb/>leaving the town it beat its course to the
                    public <lb/>buildings, and greatly injured that range nearest <lb/>the town.
                    Many fences in the neighbourhood, <lb/>which were in the line of its direction,
                    were also <lb/>thrown down; but how far it extended, or what <lb/>damages the
                    farmers may have sustained we have <lb/>not yet learned. Let it, however, not be
                        forgot<lb break="no"/>ten, that dreadful as the scene was, through the
                    <lb/>good providence of God, not a single life was <lb/>lost or any personal
                    injury, worth mentioning, <cb/>
                    <lb/>received, and the buildings, it is hoped, will soon <lb/>be restored to as
                    good a state as they were in be<lb break="no"/>fore.</p>

                <p>By a gentleman who arrived in this city on <lb/>Friday last from the county of
                    Ontario in the <lb/>Genesee county (the territory lately ceded by this
                    <lb/>state to the commonwealth of Massachusetts) we <lb/>are informed, that four
                    days before he left that <lb/>county, Colonel Brant from Niagara, at the
                    <lb/>head of between 16 and 1800 of the principal <lb/> Sachems, and other
                    Indians of the Six Nations, <lb/>had arrived at Conadoque, the seat of Oliver
                    <lb/>Phelps, Esq; on a visit of friendship, and at the <lb/>same time to receive
                    the money due them for the <lb/>lands sold to the company of Messrs. Gorham and
                    <lb/>Phelps&#x2013;That they were met by Mr. Phelps <lb/>and the principal
                    inhabitants of Conadoque, four <lb/>miles from that place, and conducted into
                    town <lb/>&#x2013;That they were highly gratified with the treat<lb break="no"
                    />ment they received, and with the manner in which <lb/>they had disposed of
                    their lands.&#x2013;The gentle<lb break="no"/>man further informs, that there is
                    now about <lb/>3000 inhabitants in the above county, and that <lb/>the land is
                    of a good quality.</p>

                <p>The weather last week, in this city, and su<lb break="no"/>burbs, continued to be
                    extremely hot until Sunday <lb/>midnight, after a thunder squall. The change
                    <lb/>which then took place was very sudden and un<lb break="no"/>healthy.</p>
                <p>Upwards of twenty persons fell unhappy [?]ic <lb/>tions to the heat last week;
                    and it is said, <lb/>that as many of them died by over labouring <lb/>as by
                    drinking cold water, Raw rum has been <lb/>found exceedingly pernicious in this
                    extreme heat; <lb/>&#x2013;man who was seen intoxicated but a few mom<lb

                    <lb/>&#x2013;and the cry was&#x2013;" Poor fellow! he has cer<lb break="no"

                <p><pb n="2"/> We have been favoured by a friend with the <lb/>following extract of
                    a letter from Grenada, by <lb/>the last West India Packet.</p>
                <p>"A Mr. C&#x2013; has just arrive here from <lb/>Martinico, where he left the
                    white inhabitants in <lb/>arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea,
                    <lb/>that the Parliament of England had set the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish negroes
                    free ; where upon those on several of <lb/>the most considerable estates
                    assembled together <lb/>to the amount of 4000, and retired to the moun<lb
                        break="no"/>tains, declaring, they would no longer be slaves ; <lb/>saying,
                    that they had as good a right to be free, <lb/>as the negroes in the English
                    islands. What has <lb/>been the event is unknown ; but some reports say
                    <lb/>that they had arms, and had resisted the military <lb/>and the militia ;
                    and that 400 had been taken <lb/>and condemned to die. It is a little singular
                    that <lb/>such an alarming spirit of discontent should first <lb/>make its
                    appearance among the French negroes, <lb/>if they are (as has been assented by
                    several writers) <lb/>so much more civilized, so much better treated, <lb/>than
                    those of the English islands. God knows <lb/>what bloodshed may soon follow,
                    from the mis<lb break="no"/>taken humanity of some well meaning, but ill
                    <lb/>informed leaders among you."</p>

                <p>"It is with great concern I communicate to <lb/>you the following truly
                    melancholy intelligence: <lb/>&#x2013;About three weeks ago, Mr. Richard
                        Cheno<lb break="no"/>weth, had six or eight men allowed him, by the
                    <lb/>officer of the garrison at the Falls, to guard his <lb/>exposed plantation,
                    in Bear Crab Settlement, be<lb break="no"/>low the Falls. In the evening of
                    their arrival, <lb/>before they had taken their station as a guard, <lb/>a
                    number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's <lb/>house, killed two of the
                    soldiers, and three of Mr. <lb/>Chenoweth's children, and tomahawked and
                        scalp<lb break="no"/>ed his wife, leaving her on the floor for dead&#x2013;
                    <lb/>Mr. Chenoweth, (who had his arm broke by the <lb/>savages) with the rest of
                    the men, made their <lb/>escape.&#x2013;There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's
                    <lb/>children sick, in a chamber, and, it is reported, <lb/>she never heard any
                    thing of the dreadful massacre; <lb/>but, next morning, crawling down stairs,
                    she was <lb/>inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved pa<lb break="no"
                    />rent almost breathless&#x2013;Mr. Chenoweth returned <lb/>next day to his
                    house, and carried his wife to a <lb/>neighbouring plantation, where they are
                    both <lb/>likely to recover, and, what is remarkable, she <lb/>wants to return
                    to her own house.&#x2013;The savages <lb/>have been very troublesome in this
                    neighbourhood. <lb/>&#x2013;A small company are gone to White River, to
                    <lb/>extirpate 80 or 90 Indians, who, as spies have in<lb break="no"/>formed,
                    have upwards of 300 horses, &amp;c. at that <lb/>place."</p>

                <p>That the present Revolution in France is a con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the
                    Revolution in America, cannot <lb/>admit of a doubt. The American Revolution
                        o<lb break="no"/>riginated in Adams, a very insignificant Bosto<lb
                        break="no"/>nian. Not that this Adams had the least expec<lb break="no"
                    />tation of American independence, when he fo<lb break="no"/>mented the
                    opposition to the stamp-act; indeed <lb/>no human wisdom could possibly have
                    foreseen <lb/>the subsequent folly and imprudence of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish
                    administration and its obsequious Parliament. <lb/>An Administration so totally
                    destitute of common <lb/>sense, so totally ignorant of every princple of
                    <lb/>sound policy, no nation ever beheld. Adams had <lb/>the sagacity to avail
                    himself of such despicable <cb/>
                    <lb/>policies.&#x2013;Fortunately for the American cause, <lb/>the Generals that
                    were sent from England were <lb/>of congenial abilities with the Minister, and
                    the <lb/>Americans themselves were surprised at the faci<lb break="no"/>lity
                    with which they acquired their independence. <lb/>&#x2013;Yet all the blunders
                    of the British administra<lb break="no"/>tion, and the miserable conduct of the
                    British <lb/>Generals, would hardly have been sufficient to <lb/>emancipate
                    America, notwithstanding her ex<lb break="no"/>treme weakeness, without the
                    assistance of France; <lb/>and this assistance depended entirely on Dr.
                    <lb/>Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-phi<lb break="no"/>lippic of a
                    certain great lawyer. Such, therefore, <lb/>is the chain of concurrent
                    circumstances that hath <lb/>overturned the French monarch. If the British
                    <lb/>minister had possessed common sagacity&#x2013;if he <lb/>could have
                    distinguished a general from a corpo<lb break="no"/>ral; if Franklin had been
                    treated with common <lb/>civility, America would have remained a British
                    <lb/>colony, and France an absolute monarch, for <lb/>ages yet to come.</p>

                    of your <lb/>nation to read and write in your own way. The <lb/>place is much
                    improved since you ahve had any <lb/>letters form it, as there was no person
                    without a <lb/>habitation, and being in some order, when he <lb/>left it. Except
                    wearing apparel, very little is <lb/>wanting but business ; but you may thank
                    the <lb/>Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought <lb/>several useful
                    things there. The last crops of <lb/>corn, and the garden grounds, were in very
                    good <lb/>condition : and what makes the settlement more <lb/>convenient, one of
                    the people who came in the <lb/>first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for
                    use <lb/>and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that <lb/>of Delft or
                    elsewhere. He was surprised to see <lb/>so many people without hats or shoes,
                    and houses <lb/>without windows, and full of wicker and rush <lb/>furniture,
                    which is used in th eplace of almost <lb/>every thing else. If the smiths had a
                    plentiful <lb/>supply of coal and iron, hardly any utensils would <lb/>be
                    wanting. Your nephew has two children, and <lb/>says all that are born there are
                    very healthy, and <lb/>more born than are buried or executed of grown
                    <lb/>people. The Christians Church was quite finish<lb break="no"/>ed before he
                    came away ; and he thinks if there <lb/>were enough of your people, they might
                    have a <lb/>place to themselves. The farthest of the lines <lb/>was seldom
                    visited by the savages ; and it was <lb/>reported when he came away, that as
                    soon as <lb/>more troops and a new Governor comes over, <lb/>they would go
                    farther than ever up the country, <lb/>when some valuable discovers are expected
                    to be <lb/>made ; they have a gum which may be used for <lb/>gum arabic, which
                    is veyr useful. He ex<lb break="no"/>pects several of your people will go from
                    Batavia <lb/>to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way <lb/>for sending old
                    clothes is not yet found out. <lb/>Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited, that
                    it is not <lb/>worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as lit<lb break="no"
                    />tle is said about it there, as if it was as far off as <lb/>Europe, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.</p>

                <p><pb n="6"/> The West India merchants, who were in the <lb/>utmost anxiety for the
                    arrival of the packet from <lb/>the West Indies, have been most agreebly
                        relie<lb break="no"/>ed from their apprehensions. The account of the
                    <lb/>insurrections in Martinique, which we received <lb/>through France, and
                    which has been since con<lb break="no"/>firmed in the National Assembly,
                    naturally alarm<lb break="no"/>ed them for the British islands. We are happy
                    <lb/>to inform our readers, that the packet brings no <lb/>intelligence whatever
                    of tumult of insurrections. <lb/>We have not heard even that the letters bring
                    <lb/>any account of the conspiracy in Martinique ; a <lb/>circumstance which can
                    only be accounted for by <lb/>the little communication which exists between the

                    discovered in Martinico : It <lb/>was an insurrection of the negroes, who were
                    that <lb/>night to have set fire to the large and beautiful <lb/>town of St.
                    Pierre ; while the white people were <lb/>all in confusion, and striving to
                    escape the flames, <lb/>they were to be butchered indiscriminately, man
                    <lb/>woman, and child.&#x2013;The combustibles were laid <lb/>in upwards of 100
                    houses, consisting of hemp dip<lb break="no"/>ped in turpentine. The plot was
                    not discovered <lb/>till five o'clock in the evening, when a negro be<lb

                    he must murder the woman who <lb/>brought him up form a child, disclosed it to
                    her. <lb/>The Troops being thereupon assembled, 40 of the <lb/>negroes were
                    taken, armed with a hanger and a <lb/>long knife, the insturments which were in
                    a few <lb/>hours to have put a period to the existence of up<lb break="no"
                    />wards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have <lb/>been under arms ever
                    since, as they are afraid the <lb/>negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are
                    in <lb/>gaol."</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">To the PRINTER</hi>.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir,</hi>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">ABOUT</hi> two month ago I went to the coun<lb break="no"
                    />try to pay a visit to a friend in a remote <lb/>county; and though I am much
                    of what may be called "a <hi rend="italic"> newspaper man</hi>," I never thought
                    of or<lb break="no"/>dering my papers to be sent down to me. To <lb/>my utter
                    astonishment, my <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi> landlord did <lb/>not take in own
                    newspaper; so there was I, stuck <lb/>down, with my friend in the
                    country&#x2013;knowing <lb/>no more of what passed in town than if I had
                    <lb/>been in <hi rend="italic">Lapland</hi>. Intending every day should be
                    <lb/>my last, I went on without ordering your, or any <lb/>other paper, till two
                    months had passed away, at <lb/>which period I returned to town. And there,
                    <lb/>Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had <lb/>dropped down from the
                    clouds. Every day I <lb/>heard people talking of occurrences of which I
                    <lb/>knew nothing : Revolutions in France by <hi rend="italic">Fish</hi><lb
                        break="no"/><hi rend="italic">women</hi> ; and battles in Flanders, against
                    the <lb/>Emperor, who I thought was fighting against <lb/>the Turks.</p>
                <p>But even this was not the most distressing&#x2013;for <lb/>one day meeting a
                    friend, I inquired very cor<lb break="no"/>dially after his wife, who I found a
                    few days af<lb break="no"/>terwards, had eloped just before with another
                    <lb/>gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquir<lb break="no"/>ed kindly for
                    her sister, who I found had depart<lb break="no"/>ed to the other world a
                    fortnight before.</p>
                <p>On this account I never will stir again "out of <lb/>the world" unless your paper
                    goes along with me. I <lb/>hold a newspaper to be a kind of <hi rend="italic"
                        >viaticum</hi> with <lb/>which every man should be provided, and which be<lb
                        break="no"/>come the more necessary the further we remove <lb/>from town It.
                    is the only way to keep pace with <lb/>what is going on every day in the
                    fashionable or <lb/>literary world&#x2013;and to prevent talking about dead
                    <lb/>friends, or wives that have absconded.</p>
                <p>In short, Sir, a newspaper is my <hi rend="italic">creed</hi>&#x2013;and ne<lb
                        break="no"/>ver will I again travel without my faith along with <lb/>me :
                    having fully experienced the unpleasantness <lb/>of being sent back into the
                    world as ignorant as <lb/>if I had been born again&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">I
                        hereby give notice</hi>&#x2013; <lb/>"That if an <hi rend="italic"
                        >hottentot</hi> friend of mine invites me, <lb/>who does not take in your
                    paper or some other&#x2013; <lb/>I will not visit him."<hi rend="smallcaps">DICK
                        DESPERATE</hi>.</p>

                <p><hi rend="enlarged-capital">I</hi>N the United States of America there are some
                    <lb/>Jews, and various denomications of Christians, <lb/>&#x2013;as Roman
                    Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, <lb/>Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers,
                    Dunkers, <lb/>Moravians, Deists, Methodists, Newlights, San<lb break="no"
                    />dimanians, Universalists, and Shaking Quakers; <lb/>all of whom are allowed to
                    perform religious wor<lb break="no"/>ship accoridng to the dictates of their
                    consciences.</p>
                <p>The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that <lb/>sprang up about the year 1769 : an
                    old woman <lb/>called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all <lb/>of which
                    were said to be Europeans, were the <lb/>founders of this new mode of worship ;
                    they drew <lb/>thousands of people after them, who pretended <lb/>they were
                    visited with power from on high to <lb/>work miracles, heal the sick, raise the
                    dead, cast <lb/>out devils, and speak in unknown languages.</p>
                <p>This Lady risided in the north-westerly part <lb/>of the State of New York, where
                    she began to <lb/>instil her tenets into some of the people there:&#x2013;
                    <lb/>afterwards she rambled from place to place, pro<lb break="no"/>mulgating
                    her religion, and gaining proselytes in <lb/>New England, and
                    elsewhere:&#x2013;she engrossed the <lb/>kingdom of heaven to herself and
                    followers, to <lb/>the seculsion of all others.</p>
                <p>She pretended her mission was immediately from <lb/>heaven;&#x2013;that she
                    travelled in pain for her elect, <lb/>&#x2013;could speak in seventry-two
                    unknown languages, <lb/>in which she conversed with those that had de<lb
                        break="no"/>parted this life,&#x2013;that there had not been a true
                    <lb/>church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, <lb/>until her's was
                    erected,&#x2013;that both the living and <lb/>the dead must be saved, in, by,
                    and through her <lb/>&#x2013;must confess their sins unto her, and procure
                    <lb/>her parson, or they could not be saved;&#x2013;that <lb/>that she gathered
                    her church from both earth and <lb/>hell, as every person that had died since
                    the time <lb/>of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was <lb/>damned, and
                    that they were ocntinually making <lb/>intercession to her for salvation, which
                    was the <lb/>occasion of her talking to them in those unknown <lb/>tongues.</p>
                <p>Those that entered into her church were ob<lb break="no"/>liged to confess their
                    sins, and deliver up their <lb/>jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches,
                    &amp;c. to <lb/>be disposed of as she thought fit.</p>
                <p>It has been reported that some of these confes<lb break="no"/>sions proved very
                    beneficial; for some of her <lb/>church members owned they had stolen things
                    that <lb/>had been laid to innocent persons.</p>
                <p>When these people carry on their worship, they <lb/>pretend to praise the Lord by
                    singing, dancing, <lb/>jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling,
                    <lb/>&amp;c. and in the mean time some will be trembling, <lb/>groaning,
                    sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are <lb/>preaching, praying, exhorting,
                    &amp;c. others will be <lb/>clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, scream<lb
                        break="no"/>ing, and making such a hideous noise, that it <lb/>may be heard
                    at a great distance, and will often <lb/>affrighten the spectators.</p>
                <p>They often dance three hours without inter<lb break="no"/>mission, and when any
                    of them are tired of prais<lb break="no"/>ing the Lord that way, they are
                    whipped by o<lb break="no"/>thers, to make the worship go on briskly. <cb/>
                    <lb/>They dance till they are much emaciated ; the <lb/>young women grow pale,
                    appear like ghosts or <lb/>apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard,
                    <lb/>&#x2013;if I may use the sailor's phrase.</p>
                <p>They make no use of the Eucharist, or of wa<lb break="no"/>ter baptism in their
                    churchs; are averse to wars, <lb/>fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain
                        lan<lb break="no"/>guage, and cry&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">yea</hi>, and <hi
                        rend="italic">nay</hi>, instead of <hi rend="italic">yes</hi> and <lb/><hi
                        rend="italic">no</hi>: but the other Quakers do not approve of all
                    <lb/>their tenets.</p>
                <p>At particular times they labour very hard at <lb/>their respective occupations,
                    and are very careful <lb/>that no time is spent in idleness.</p>
                <p>They pretend they hold a correspondence with <lb/>the saints and angels, and that
                    they frequently <lb/>see and converse with the spirits of their departed
                    <lb/>friends.</p>
                <p>Many of them refuse to be with their wives, <lb/>because they suppose they are
                    part of the hundred <lb/>and forty and four thousand mentioned in the
                    <lb/>Revelations that were redeemed from the earth, <lb/>and were not defiled
                    with women.</p>
                <p>They hold, that they have already been made <lb/>partakers of the first
                    resurrection, and that on <lb/>them the second death will have no power.</p>
                <p>They do not allows the instrumental music in <lb/>their churches, because they
                    suppose it was cere<lb break="no"/>monial, and is abolished;&#x2013;but pretend
                    that they <lb/>carry on their worship by the immediate power <lb/>and influence
                    of the Holy Ghost, and that they <lb/>have scripture warrents for their
                    practice, a[?]&#x2013; <lb/>Sing unto God,&#x2013;Praise the Lord in the dance;
                    <lb/>&#x2013;O clap your hands, all ye people;&#x2013;Shout on <lb/>to
                    God;&#x2013;Make a joyful noise;&#x2013;Fall down be<lb break="no"/>fore the
                    Lords,&amp;c.</p>

                <p>The disturbances in this island are so far from <lb/>having abated, that they
                    seem daily to gain ad<lb break="no"/>ditional force. The French General, after
                    the <lb/>and endeavoured to bring over a part of the mi<lb break="no"/>litary to
                    his side, against the people : He began <lb/>with subalterns, several of whom
                    took a cer<lb break="no"/>tain oath of attachment which he administered to
                    <lb/>them ; but when he came to the Major, that of<lb break="no"/>ficer
                    declined, saying he had already engaged <lb/>himself on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >side of the people</hi>. Incensed at this <lb/>reply, he reviled him in
                    very opprobrious terms, <lb/>and at last laid his cane upon him !</p>
                <p>Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry, <lb/>he made his next application
                    to the regiment of <lb/>artillery, but with as little success. They inform<lb
                        break="no"/>ed him, that themselves and Culverins were sta<lb break="no"
                    />tioned there for the protection of the <hi rend="italic">people</hi>, and
                    <lb/> for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> only should be used.</p>
                <p>Driven to the last shift, his distress suggested <lb/>the sorry expedient of
                    having recourse to the <hi rend="italic">peo</hi><lb break="no"/><hi
                        rend="italic">ple</hi> of <hi rend="italic">colour</hi>, who <hi

                    flattery these people, so rea<lb break="no"/>dily to be caught by a little
                    seeming attention, <lb/>promised to stand by him ; and did so, as long <lb/>as
                    they usually stand firm to any thing&#x2013;that is, till <lb/>their fears for
                    their own persons became an ob<lb break="no"/>ject of more weighty
                    concern&#x2013;they then aban<lb break="no"/>doned him.</p>
                <p>The humiliating familiarities to which he de<lb break="no"/>scended to this
                    motley rabble, were truly disgust<lb break="no"/>ing. He embraced them; called
                    them his <hi rend="italic">enfans</hi>
                    <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">cher amis</hi>, and practised all the dirty conde<lb
                        break="no"/>scensions, which those only who are conversant in <lb/>the
                    praise-worthy art of cajoling, can form any <lb/>conception of.</p>
                <p>The effect of this conduct was, as might be ex<lb break="no"/>pected,
                    insolence&#x2013;one of this banditti presumed <lb/>to strike a
                    grenadier&#x2013;this incensed both the mi<lb break="no"/>litary and the
                    peopl&#x2013;the consequence was, their <lb/>doughty leader was laid hold of,
                    when his trusty <lb/>defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into
                    <lb/>confinement, and had the pleasure of beholding <lb/>from the windows of his
                    prison, him whom he had <lb/>inspired with the insolent temerity to strike
                    <lb/>White, suspended on a gibbet.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled <lb/>to confer on the measures to be
                    taken on this oc<lb break="no"/>casion, when ten deputies were chosen to bring
                    <lb/>the deposed Commander to that part of the island <lb/>for trial, and twelve
                    Judges were chosen to pre<lb break="no"/>side at that very important
                    tribunal.</p>
                <p>Thus stood matters on Thursday last, at which <lb/>time a rumour prevailed that
                    the Marquis de <lb/>Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary <lb/>and
                    ingenious method of being put between two <lb/>planks and severed in pieces by a
                    cross-cut saw.</p>

                <p>"Congress is still sitting at New York, and <lb/>from the multiplicity of
                    business before them, <lb/>there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing.
                    <lb/>We are curious to know what foreigners will say</p>
                <p><pb/>of our new commercial arrangements. Among <lb/>ourselves there is but one
                    opinion, and that is fa<lb break="no"/>avourable. o our own vessels, a
                    preference is <lb/>undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and
                    <lb/>merchandise, there is no discrimination in our <lb/>import and tonnage
                    acts, every nation being on <lb/>the same footing. With respect to the duties

                <p>"Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of <lb/>improvement in politics and
                    commerce, we <lb/>feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine <lb/>wishes.

                    respectability. <lb/>The prejudices and animosities created by the <lb/>late

                    flowing from the same <lb/>source, industry has in a great degree succeeded.
                    <lb/>A progress has also been made in manufactures <lb/>of various kinds that
                    was not expected ; and the <lb/>persevering in them affords a strong presumption
                    <lb/>of those concerned deriving advantage.</p>
                <p>"Throughout the union, the public opinion <lb/>on matters of government has of
                    late experien<lb break="no"/>ced rapid changes. Vice President Adams, in
                    <lb/>his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated <lb/>the absurdity of
                    democracy, and the superior ex<lb break="no"/>cellence of a mix form, such as
                    that of Britain. <lb/>His deductions from premises admitted as just, <lb/>have
                    abated much of the popular aversion to mo<lb break="no"/>narchy ; and as every
                    thing matures quickly in <lb/>our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise
                    many, <lb/>were United America to have a sovereign ear<lb break="no"/>in the
                    next century.</p>
                <p>"In no one instance has our new admnistra<lb break="no"/>tion given general
                    satisfaction, more than in their <lb/>conduct towards the Indians. The interests
                    of <lb/>those unfortunate people will be studiously attend<lb break="no"/>ed to
                    ; and they will be effectually protected a<lb break="no"/>gainst the lawless
                    violence of the individuals or <lb/>States, who wished to wrest their lands from
                    them. <lb/>This determination is dictated by policy as well <lb/>humanity ; for
                    it is now become the interest of <lb/>the States to check, by every means short
                    of <lb/>violence, the erratic disposition of their citizens, <lb/>who, when
                    removed to the wilds beyond the <lb/>mountains, cannot be regarded as of any
                    value, <lb/>in a political view.</p>

                    <lb/>Holland, as one of the finest harbours in the <lb/>world, in which 1000
                    sail of the line might ride <lb/>in perfect security. Sydney cove, named so in

                    about hal a mile in length, <lb/>and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance.
                    <lb/>HEre was the finest spring water, and ships can <lb/>anchor so close in

                <p><pb/>The Minister is now said to be employed in <lb/>drawing up two plans, which
                    will give rise to <lb/>very warm debates in Parliament : one is for set<lb
                        break="no"/>tling a commercial arrangement between Great <lb/>Britain and
                    Ireland ; the other for giving a con<lb break="no"/>stitution to Canada. In
                    feeling the former, the <lb/>Minister will have to contend with strong com<lb
                        break="no"/>mercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to
                    <lb/>encounter religious principles. The British <lb/>settlers in Canada are
                    comparatively few in num<lb break="no"/>ber. The great bulk of the Canadians are
                    the <lb/>descendants of French, and are Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lics. The
                    former are Protestants.</p>
                <p>Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, <lb/>were not fonder of peace than Mr.
                    Pitt. Con<lb break="no"/>quests may be made by war, but consequence and
                    <lb/>wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, <lb/>if the first
                    commercial nation in the world.</p>
                <p>Besides these considerations, the grand secret <lb/>has been discovered since the
                    present Minister <lb/>came into power, that the best riddance England <lb/>ever
                    had, was of her American Colonies ; because <lb/>by this means, she becomes
                    thoroughly collected <lb/>at home, to oppose every foreign power, without
                    <lb/>the expence and blood of supporting the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans, at the
                    same time that they cannot do with<lb break="no"/>out BRitish manufactures in
                    one line or another.</p>
                <p>Thus, they are under the necessity of protect<lb break="no"/>ing themselves, at
                    the same time, that, like the <lb/>rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to
                    our <lb/>superior mercantile market.</p>
                <p>Application has been lately made to the Lords <lb/>of the Treasury for an order
                    on the Bank to issue <lb/>some of the new silver coin, in aid of the pre<lb
                        break="no"/>sent want of silver for circulation, the scarcity <lb/>of which
                    is much felt by retail traders in par<lb break="no"/>ticular.</p>

                <p><pb/>Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arri<lb break="no"/>ved there from
                    Hispaniola, there are advices that <lb/>the French inhabitants of that island
                    feel, with <lb/>unabating energy, the glorious cause in which <lb/>their
                    patriotic countrymen in Old France are em<lb break="no"/>barked. Men of every
                    class and description wear <lb/>the national cockade of blue and white. Their
                    <lb/>accounts from France, similar in date and sub<lb break="no"/>stance to
                    ours, have filled them with the most <lb/>lively hopes, and animated them with a
                    spirit of <lb/>resistance to the measures of their Government, <lb/>as forcible
                    as it was unexpected by those entrust<lb break="no"/>ed with the executive
                    power. At Port au Prince <lb/>both the Governor and Intendant have rendered
                    <lb/>themselves completely odious, by vain attempts <lb/>to counteract an
                    impulse that is irresistible. The <lb/>effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has
                    been <lb/>hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that <lb/>both shall
                    immediately quit the colony, and their <lb/>departure is hourly expected. The
                    press, hither<lb break="no"/>to under the severest restraint, triumphs in its
                        free<lb break="no"/>dom; and their weekly publications give an ac<lb
                        break="no"/>count of the proceedings of the States General <lb/>without the
                    smallest reserve.</p>

                <p><pb/>The following philosophical facts lead us to <lb/>presume that the winter
                    now setting in, will prove <lb/>a mild one : It has been constantly remarked,
                    that <lb/>when this season commences early, and with se<lb break="no"/>verity,
                    in Newfoundland, and the more northern <lb/>part of North America, it becomes
                    extremely ri<lb break="no"/>gorous, and of a proportionate continuance there.
                    <lb/>When, in the above climate, the winters have <lb/>been severe, they have
                    invariably been mild with <lb/>us, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>. Now,
                    the ships which sailed <lb/>from Newfoundland the beginning of October <lb/><hi
                        rend="italic">last</hi>, saw the hills already covered with snow. <lb/>There
                    is still another argument in favour of a mild <lb/>winter with us. Previously to
                    the setting in of a <lb/>severe one, nature, in her bounty, has been always
                    <lb/>observed to have provided an uncommon store of <lb/>wild briar fruits, as a
                    nourishment to the smaller <lb/>birds, who would otherwise perish, a vast carpet
                    <lb/>of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to <lb/>prevent their
                    coming at the worms, &amp;c. on which <lb/>they are accustomed to feed. The
                    present sea<lb break="no"/>son, the store of these wild fruits is extremely
                        mo<lb break="no"/>derate.</p>

                <p>"The convicts already arrived at this port <lb/>from Newfoundland, are near
                    fourscore in num<lb break="no"/>ber; a few others are expected. These unhap<lb
                        break="no"/>py wretches are almost destitute of every sort of <lb/>covering,
                    and some of them are labouring under <lb/>sickness and infirmity. Their story is
                        accurate<lb break="no"/>as follows: About the middle of last June, <lb/>this
                    miserable class of beings, to the amount of <lb/>102 men and boys, and twelve
                    women, all of <lb/>whom were convicts, were embarked at Dublin, <lb/>on board
                    the Duke of Leinster transport, the <lb/>owners of which, who are Dublin
                    merchants, <lb/>contracted with the Government of Ireland for <lb/>carrying the
                    convicts to the North American <lb/>States.</p>
                <p>"After the ship had been at sea five weeks, <lb/>part of which was foul weather,
                    the provision is <lb/>said to have fallen short ; the master of the trans<lb
                        break="no"/>port, Capt. Harrison, accordingly stood in for <lb/>Newfoundland
                    and lay-to till night; when he <lb/>disembarked at Bull's Bay, and a little
                    distance <lb/>from it, with as much secrecy as possible, his des<lb break="no"
                    />perate freight.</p>
                <p>"To prevent this proceeding being too early <lb/>early known, he landed with them
                    provision for the <lb/>immediate supply of their wants, and bore away <lb/>with
                    a press of sail. The hungry victims lived <lb/>for three days in a state of
                    warfare, quarrelling <lb/>about their food ; the strongest beat the weak,
                    <lb/>and over a cask of rank butter or beef, there <lb/>was for a time as severe
                    fighting as if a kingdom <lb/>had been at stake.</p>
                <p>"They reached the town of St. John's on <lb/>the 20th of July ; and exhibited the
                    most appal<lb break="no"/>ing procession ever seen in that country : the in<lb
                        break="no"/>habitants had immediate councils; and the mili<lb break="no"
                    />tary and navy co-operating, a place of security <lb/>was fixed upon at a
                    distance from the town, and <lb/>they were lodged ; here under a guard.</p>
                <p>"Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full <lb/>chorus, and the centinels were
                    frequently fright<lb break="no"/>ed with the noise while on their posts. A
                    battle <lb/>or two every half hour kept them festive all day; <lb/>and when the
                    provision supplied to them by the <lb/>inhabitants was lessening, they broke
                    away, and <lb/>laid hold of every thing that was eatable, with<lb break="no"
                    />out enquiring whether it had an owner.</p>
                <p>"Some of these poor wretches were anxious <lb/>to be received into the service of
                    the inhabitants <lb/>and probably might have reformed, if so fostered. <lb/>But
                    all of them have a claim to the charity of <lb/>this country for that supply of
                    raiment which is <lb/>necessary to guard them against the inclement
                    <lb/>weather."</p>

                <p>"Happy are those who have quitted this land of <lb/>misery ; and I belive a

                    <lb/>They are all in the secret, sighing for the com<lb break="no"/>forts of Old
                    England. A bare pittance there, <lb/>would be preferable to the largest

                    <lb/>disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from <lb/>which statement he

                <p><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 12. On Thursday last the Viscount de
                    <lb/>Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and ball to <lb/>a number of
                    respectable ladies of gentleman of <lb/>this town on board l'Illustre, of
                    seventy-four guns. <lb/>The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge,
                    <lb/>received the company at Foster's wharf, before <lb/>12 o'clock&#x2013;and
                    on the appearance of the first <lb/>boat having ladies on board, a signal gun
                    was fir<lb break="no"/>ed from l'Illustre, and in an instant the squadron
                    <lb/>was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all na<lb break="no"/>tions. On
                    arriving at the ship, the company <lb/>were very politely received by the
                    Viscount, and <lb/>conducted to the state room&#x2013;the marines saluting
                    <lb/>as the company passed them. At one o'clock <lb/>the whole sat down to a
                    table liberally spread with <lb/>a profusion of luxuries and delicacies, in a
                    hall e<lb break="no"/>rected for the occasion, which was very fancifully
                    <lb/>decorated. At the head of the table was a castle <lb/>of pastry, having
                    thirteen metal guns, by which <lb/>from tubes that communicated through the
                    table, <lb/>and the company were saluted with a f&#x2013;deral dis<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>charge. On the top of the castle waved a small <lb/>white ensign&#x2013;the
                    device, <hi rend="italic">two hearts</hi>&#x2013;the motto, <lb/>"<hi
                        rend="italic">The United hearts of America and France</hi>." <lb/>The head
                    of the hall was ornamented with a <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>
                    <lb/>pieced with arrows&#x2013;and in the motton, "<hi rend="italic">Ho</hi><lb
                        break="no"/><hi rend="italic">mage to the fair daughters of America</hi>," a
                    fine com<lb break="no"/>pliment made by the noble Viscount to his fe<lb
                        break="no"/>male guests. After dinner, the ball began, and <lb/>closed
                    before nine o'clock, and on departure, his <lb/>Excellency was saluted with
                    thirteen rockets let <lb/>off from a boat moored at some distance from the
                    <lb/>ship.</p>
                <p>Rhode Island and North Carolina yet remain a<lb break="no"/>verse to the new
                    government; they refuse alle<lb break="no"/>giance to all acts of the States,
                    and, of course, do <lb/>not participate in any privilee; they are treated
                    <lb/>in respect to port entries, &amp;c. as foreign States.</p>

                    supercilious, they <lb/>are full of courtesy, and fond of society ; more

                <p><pb n="7"/> We have this day received Quebec newspapers <lb/>down to the 24th
                    May, from which the following <lb/>is extracted:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Quebec, May</hi> 20. </hi>
                </p>
                <p>We hear late accounts from Niagara mention, <lb/>that the Indians in that quarter
                    are much alarm<lb break="no"/>ed in consequence of a message said to be received
                    <lb/>by them from the States, that they had now rais<lb break="no"/>ed an army
                    to take their own for Niagara, and <lb/>that two thousand men of that army were
                    now on <lb/>their way from New York&#x2013;desiring the Indians <lb/>to lye
                    still and look on, and that they would pu<lb break="no"/>nish those that should
                    interfere.</p>
                <p>It was also said, that the people of New York <lb/>were determined of themselves
                    to lay open the post <lb/>of Oswego, and that emissaries had been employ<lb
                        break="no"/>ed to persuade the Indians they would be greatly <lb/>benefited
                    by that event.</p>
                <p>We are rather inclined to believe the Indians <lb/>are too sensible of the great
                    benefits already con<lb break="no"/>ferred upon them by our neighbours in buying
                    <lb/>their lands from them, to think of accepting any <lb/>more from that
                    quarter, and we would recom <lb/>mend it to the new-born Sovereignty on this
                    side <lb/>the Atlantic, before they testify their impatience, <lb/>that national
                    treaties, like private agreements, are <lb/>not to be infringed by one and
                    performed by the <lb/>other party&#x2013;Pay and you shall receive.</p>
                <p>[As to the Americans making an attempt up<lb break="no"/>on Niagara, they have
                    long had it in contempla<lb break="no"/>tion to get possession of <hi
                        rend="italic">our posts</hi> upon the lakes <lb/>in Canada.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">May </hi>24.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop <lb/>Washington, have received
                    letters from the Captian <lb/>Kendrick, dated at Nootka in July last; he in<lb
                        break="no"/>forms them, that he passed the winter preceding <lb/>on the
                    north-west coast of America; that he was <lb/>then bound on a voyage further
                    northward, and <lb/>from thence intended to proceed to Canton.&#x2013; <lb/>The
                    letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spa<lb break="no"/>nish fleet that had
                    been at Nootka, and from thence <lb/>to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New
                    York. <lb/>They were covered to the President of the United <lb/>States of
                    America.</p>
                <p>[From what appeared in our paper of Friday <lb/>last, <hi rend="italic">(see
                        Glasgow Intelligence, p</hi>. 424<hi rend="italic">)</hi> and what is
                    <lb/>mentioned above, it seems very probable that the <lb/>affair of <hi

                    the Americans and Spaniards, <lb/>as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for

                <p><pb/>By recent letters from America we learn, that <lb/>the Congress of the nited
                    States, after warm de<lb break="no"/>bates in both Houses, particularly in that
                    of the <lb/>Representatives, passed an act for the purpose of <lb/>fixing
                    permanently their seat of Government at <lb/>German Town in Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>The two new provinces in North America, <lb/>Kentucky and Vermont, whose
                    population already <lb/>is so very considerable, were formed by the vast
                    <lb/>numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruc<lb break="no"/>tion and
                    ravages of the unhappy contest between <lb/>Great Britain and her colonies, and
                    though the <lb/>greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists, <lb/>yet they
                    have now jooined the American confede<lb break="no"/>ration. Seated on the banks
                    of the great river <lb/>Mississippi, far to the westward of all the other
                    <lb/>states, they can either navigate northerly to the <lb/>lakes, or southerly
                    to the Spanish settlements on <lb/>the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, and carry
                    on a <lb/>lucrative trade with the Indians. They are pos<lb break="no"/>sessed
                    of as fertile a tract of country as any in the <lb/>world, the position of which
                    they <supplied>???</supplied> also s<supplied>???</supplied>d <cb/>
                    <lb/>by navigable rivers to Maryland, Virginia, and <lb/>Pennsylvania, and from

                    country in Europe. Thus, from <lb/>the most distressed situation, to rise to
                    opulence <lb/>and independence ina few years, must excite ad<lb break="no"
                    />miration.</p>
                <p>Agriculture, at present, seems to be the pecu<lb break="no"/>liar province of
                    American industry, from whence <lb/>wealth will flow into every part of that
                    vast coun<lb break="no"/>try, as it abounds in large tracts of rich land,
                    <lb/>level grounds, with a deep soil, and extended sa<lb break="no"/>vannahs;
                    while to the northward the fisheries and <lb/>shipbuilding amply compensate for
                    the want of <lb/>an equal fertility; and though not so abundant <lb/>in coin,
                    yet the provinces produce the finest mea<lb break="no"/>dows, form whence a
                    provision trade will be every <lb/>year increasing. The southern countries of

                    population, and which <lb/>is still augmenting, as arts and manufacturers are
                    <lb/>every where extended: America may, therefore, <lb/>be deemed, in future,
                    the granary of this quarter <lb/>of the globe.</p>

                    qualifications <lb/>he insisted on, he endeavoured to serve him <lb/>to his mind
                    ; and after many enquiries, he judged <lb/>he had found a lady fit for his
                    purpose, in a <lb/>young person of a reputable family, but no for<lb break="no"
                    />tune ; of good humour, and of a polite educa<lb break="no"/>tion ; well
                    shaped, and more than tolerably hand<lb break="no"/>some. He made the proposal
                    to her as his friend has <lb/>directed, and the young gentlewoman, who had
                    <lb/>no subsistence but from a cross old aunt, who <lb/>gave her a great deal of
                    uneasiness, accepted it. <lb/>A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting
                    <lb/>out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board <lb/>the same, together with
                    the bales of goods, being <lb/>well provided with all necessaries, and
                    particularly <lb/>with a certificate in due form, and indorsed by <lb/>the
                    correspondent. She was also included in the <lb/>invoice, the last article of
                    which ran thus : "Item, <lb/>a maid of 21 years of age, of the quality, shape
                    <lb/>and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the <lb/>affadavits and
                    certificates she has to produce." <lb/>Writings, which were thought necessary to
                    so <lb/>exact a man as the future husband, were an extract <lb/>from the parish
                    register ; a certificate of her cha<lb break="no"/>racter, signified by the
                    curate ; an attestation of <lb/>her neighbours, setting forth that she had for
                    the <lb/>space of three years lived with an old aunt who was <lb/>intolerably
                    peevish, and that she had not, during <lb/>all that time, given her said aunt,
                    the least occasion <lb/>of complaint. And li[?]y, the goodness of her
                    <lb/>consitution was certified after [?] by <lb/>[?] [?]. [?] [?] <lb/>departure
                    the London correspondent sent seve<lb break="no"/>ral letters of advice by other
                    ships to his friend, <lb/>whereby he informed him that per such a [?] <lb/>he
                    sent him a young woman of such an age, cha<lb break="no"/>racter, and condition
                    &amp;c. in a word, such [?] <lb/>desired to marry. The letters of advice, the
                    <lb/>bales, and the gentlewoman came safe to the <lb/>port ; and our Creole, who
                    happened to be one[?] <lb/>of the foremost on the pier and the lady's landing
                    <lb/>was charmed to see a handsome person, who hav<lb break="no"/>ing heard him
                    called by his name, told him, <lb/>"Sir, I have a bill of exchange upon you, and
                    you <lb/>know that it is not usually for people to carry a <lb/>great deal of
                    money about them in such a long <lb/>voyage as I have made ; I beg the favour
                    you will <lb/>pleased to pay it." At the same time she gave <lb/>him his
                    correspondent's letter, on the back of <lb/>which was wrote, " The bearer of
                    this is the <lb/>spouse you ordered me to send you." Ha, [?]<lb break="no"/>[?]
                    ! said the Creole, I never yet suffered my <lb/>bills to be protested, and I
                    swear this shall not be <lb/>the first : I shall reckon myself the most
                    fortunate <lb/>of all men, if you allow meto discharge it." <lb/>Yes, Sir,
                    replied she, and the more willingly, <lb/>since I am apprized of your character.
                    We have <lb/>several persons of honour on board, who knew <lb/>you very well,
                    and who, during my passage <lb/>have answered all the questions I asked them
                        con<lb break="no"/>cerning you, in so advantageous a manner, that <lb/>it
                    has raised in me [?] for you." <lb/>This first interview was in a few days after
                        follow<lb break="no"/>ed by the nuptials, which were very magnificent.
                    <lb/>The new married couple are satisfied with their <lb/>happy union made by
                    [?] of exchange, which <lb/>was the most fortunate that had happened in that
                    <lb/>island for many years.</p>

                    Love.</hi></p>
                <p>On Monday last was married at Stockport, an <lb/>inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a
                    female on whom <lb/>he had fixed his <hi rend="italic">affections</hi>. It is to
                    be observed, <lb/>that he did not toil through the tedious forms of
                    <lb/>courtship, but at once got a wife, as others some<lb break="no"/>times get
                    good places, by <hi rend="italic">purchase</hi>&#x2013;and, as we <lb/>are
                    informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas <lb/>and thirty yards of Irish
                    cloth, at 2s. 6d. per <lb/>yard&#x2013;which property he deposited in exchange
                    <lb/>for <hi rend="italic">earthly treasure.</hi>&#x2013;Whether a wife may be
                    <lb/>cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her <lb/>former husband,
                    having seen military service, was <lb/>not to be discomposed at <hi
                        rend="italic">trifles</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">philosophy</hi>
                    <lb/>probably being strengthened on the occasion, he <lb/>attended the happy
                    pair to church, and saw the <lb/>marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the
                    <lb/>evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was <lb/>gaity. The first
                    husband parted with an help<lb break="no"/>mate had <hi rend="italic">borne his
                        sorrows twelve years ;</hi> and <lb/>the second husband received a <hi
                        rend="italic">partner of his joys,</hi>
                    <lb/>after having buried a former one <hi rend="italic">just a week.</hi></p>

                    College, <lb/>for the support of two missionaries to preach the <lb/>gospel. The
                    city of London were left trustees, <lb/>and the management under the trust was,
                    by the <lb/>will, committed to the care of the Bishop of Lon<lb break="no"/>don.
                    The present Bishop instituted this suit, in <lb/>which the city, and a great
                    number of other per<lb break="no"/>sons, were parties, for the single, and
                    indeed novel <lb/>purpose of knowing, whether (as the teststor had
                    <lb/>originally devised the several sums <hi rend="italic">for the use of</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">British subjects, </hi>and the Americans having ceased
                    <lb/>to be in that situations <hi rend="italic">since </hi>their independence),
                    <lb/>the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom, <lb/>or to some other of
                    his Majesty's colonies, to be <lb/>applied to similar purposes. This being the
                    first <lb/>determination of that nature since the American <lb/>Revolution, the
                    Lord Chancellor decided it with <lb/>that superior dignity of sentiment that
                    always at<lb break="no"/>tends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient&#x2013;
                    <lb/>"all charitable devices are to be held sacred&#x2013; <lb/>we cannot rake
                    up the ashes of the dead, in search <lb/>of latent intentions. The annuities and
                    arrears <lb/>must be paid, and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps, <lb/>and likewise the
                    city of London, must be paid <lb/>their costs." </p>

                <p><pb/>On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs <lb/>visited the Cathedral of
                    St. Paul's, which they <lb/>explain[?] with an equal degree of curiosity and</p>
                <p><pb/>amazement. They were asked whether they <lb/>would not attend the evening
                    service, which they <lb/>readily complied, and seemed particularly de<lb
                        break="no"/>lighted with the organ.</p>
                <p>The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer <lb/>of 20,000 men, gratitude obliges
                    us to make <lb/>them some acknowledgement, whether we accept <lb/>their offer or
                    not.&#x2013;We can very well spare them <lb/>the members of the <hi

                    keepers,&#x2013;and all their ac<lb break="no"/>complices to an amazing
                    number.</p>
                <p>Such a collection would be a truly valuable <lb/>present.&#x2013;Among them are
                    found dispersedly all <lb/>the qualitities of able Generals,&#x2013;skilful
                    Financiers, <lb/>&#x2013;able Negotiators, active Citizens,&#x2013;and men
                    <lb/>highly expert at a <hi rend="italic">Coup de Main</hi>.</p>
                <p>Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe,&#x2013;the <lb/>Cherokee Chiefs might on
                    their return to their <lb/>own country enter into a boxing war against their
                    <lb/>enemies&#x2013;with a certainty of the most brilliant <lb/>success.</p>
                <p>Trading Justices and Lawyers they would per<lb break="no"/>haps be glad to have ;
                    and it is the opinion of <lb/>most people, that a few thousands of the latter
                    <lb/>description of men might be spared.</p>

                <p><pb/>By letters from the New York Packet, dated <lb/>October 6, from
                    Philadelphia, we learn that <lb/>there has been a very fine harvest in the
                        South<lb break="no"/>ern States, and that the wheat has been wonder<lb
                        break="no"/>fully productive. A very large quantity had <lb/>been bought up
                    for the Spanish markets. The <lb/>quality of European goods, imported the last
                    <lb/>season was immense, goods selling for consider<lb break="no"/>able loss ;
                    and such will always be the case when <lb/>the Merchants in England anticipate a
                    ray of <lb/>fruitfulness of the American Soil.&#x2013;The appear<lb break="no"
                    />ance of a Spanish war had given them great pro<lb break="no"/>spects of
                    commercial advantages, and a seven <lb/>years war is what the Americans were all
                        earnest<lb break="no"/>ly wishing for.</p>

                <p><pb/>When the Cherokee Chiefs first visited Covent<lb break="no"/>garden Theatre,
                    one of them appeared much de<lb break="no"/>lighted with the splendid appearance
                    of an In<lb break="no"/>dian cap worn by one of the pantomime actors; <lb/>this
                    being observed, the performer was directed <lb/>the performance; the Chief,
                    amazed at the offer <lb/>of the magnificent present, said, through his in<lb
                        break="no"/>terpreter, " that even in his won country he <lb/>should be
                    unable to repay it ; however, at pre<lb break="no"/>sent he would do the utmost
                    in his power ;" on <lb/>this he ordered the actor to approach him, and <lb/>then
                    lighting his Cherokee pipe stuffed with a <lb/>variety of nauseous combustibles,
                    he too three <lb/>whiffs himself, and presenting the tube, desired <lb/>the
                    actor to take three whiffs also&#x2013;the greatest <lb/>favour a Cherokee could
                    confer ; the actor, a<lb break="no"/>astonished at the singularity of this
                    unexpected ho<lb break="no"/>nour, reluctantly complied with the request,to the
                    <lb/>great entertainment of the Dramatic circle.</p>

                <p>This Colony is in a perfect state of anarchy ; <lb/>is so much that we have had
                    thoughts of quitting <lb/>the island, and going to Trinidad, taking the ne<lb
                        break="no"/>groes with us. Unless some speedy and effectual <lb/>succours
                    arrive, the colony is utterly ruined. The <lb/>greater part of the colonists,
                    this day, assembled <lb/>at Gros-morne.&#x2013;The grenadiers, who were in
                    <lb/>the fort of Trinity, with twenty three officers of <lb/>the regiment, were
                    glad to make their escape.&#x2013; <lb/>There are 1500 men in the FOrt Bourbon,
                    many <lb/>of whom are from Dominica, Guadaloupe, and <lb/>other colonies, an
                    supposed to have been sent by <lb/>Martinico refugees.&#x2013;The firing of
                    cannon is heard <lb/>incessantly ; at this rate the magazine of powder <lb/>will
                    soon be consumed.</p>
                <p>The Municipality of Fort Royal, have been <lb/>obliged to promise and sign
                    whatever the insur<lb break="no"/>gents have been please to dictate.&#x2013;The
                    soldiers <lb/>run about the streets and oblige the inhabitants to <lb/>give them
                    money.&#x2013;Imagine, in short, a scene of <lb/>confusion and terror, and you
                    will then have some <cb/>
                    <lb/>idea of the persent [?] of Fort Bourbon and <lb/>Fort Royal.</p>
                <p>The town of St. Pierre swarms with strangers, <lb/>who come here from all parts.
                    M. Chabrol, Co<lb break="no"/>lonel of the regiment which has been sent here,
                    <lb/>together with a company of Chaffeurs, has been <lb/>appointed comandant o
                    the NAtional troops.</p>
                <p>The women, confident that it is in his power <lb/>to re-establish tranquility,
                    prostrate themselves be<lb break="no"/>fore him, strew the ground on which he
                    walks <lb/>with flowers, and affectionately embrace him.&#x2013; <lb/>He seems
                    willing to comply with their wishes.</p>
                <p>The Colonial Assembly sits at Gros-morne <lb/>guarded by an army of 4000 men,
                    under the com<lb break="no"/>mand of M. Dumoise, appointed by the General.</p>
                <p>We are assured, that the insurgents are arming <lb/>four privateers with which
                    they mean to attack <lb/>Trinity. Some soldiers attempted to penetrate
                    <lb/>among them, but were repulsed by the Mulattoes.</p>

                </p>
                <p> IT is our wish, in imitation of other newswrit<lb break="no"/>ters, to give now
                    and then an account of such <lb/>new publications as deserve the attention of
                    the <lb/>public; but in a paper, pubished only twice a <lb/>week, where so much
                    naturally occurs under the <lb/>article of temporary news, it is but seldom we
                    can <lb/>find room for this purpose:&#x2013;when, however, a<lb break="no"/>ny
                    ting remarkable appears in the literary world, <lb/>we never fail to notice it,
                    although it may not be <lb/>in our power to give an extensive and critical ac<lb
                        break="no"/>count of its excellencies. We take up the pen <lb/>with real
                    pleasure at present to announce the pu<lb break="no"/>blication of a tragedy,
                    intitled THE INDIANS, the <lb/>reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this
                        U<lb break="no"/>niversity. The great applause with which this <lb/>play was
                    received, when performed at Richmond <lb/>Theatre, has raised the expectations
                    of those who <lb/>were not present at the performance to the high<lb break="no"
                    />est pitch; and we think we may take upon our<lb break="no"/>selves to assert,
                    that upon perusing it, even their <lb/>highest expetations will not be
                    disappointed.&#x2013; <lb/>The plot of the piece is taken from a well known
                    <lb/>story published at the end of a volum of poems, <lb/>written by the same
                    gentleman. In the choice <lb/>of a plot, where so many dramatic writers of re<lb
                        break="no"/>spectable talents have erred, our author is peculiar<lb
                        break="no"/>ly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of <lb/>Horace:</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Denique sit quid vis, simplex dumtaxat et
                            unum</hi>.</hi>
                </p>
                <p><pb/>It is simple, and yet it does not disgust by an <lb/>appearance of
                    nakedness.&#x2013;It is one, for the com<lb break="no"/>plaints of Maraino, and
                    the return of Oniyo, form <lb/>a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and
                    <lb/>Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and <lb/>defeat of those arts, an
                    end, which combin<lb break="no"/>ed wake up a compleat and connected whole. In
                    <lb/>the delineation of character the author has, on al<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>every occasion, attended to the "<hi rend="italic">quid quemque</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">decent</hi>"&#x2013;there are hoever some few parts,
                    which <lb/>the critic halts to consider, but which amidst so <lb/>many beauties,
                    he blushes to censure&#x2013;Some lines, <lb/>for instance in the character of
                    Ononthio, do not <lb/>strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much
                    <lb/>humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem, <lb/>as to prompt him to
                    spare a victim, about to be <lb/>destroyed accoridng to the custom of the
                    country; <lb/>that victim a captive of war, and not only so, but <lb/>a Briton,
                    who has been fighting against his coun- <lb/>trymen, amongst whom was his only
                    son, whom <lb/>he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much <lb/>in favour
                    of a stranger and a foe, at the risk of dis<lb break="no"/>pleasing the village,
                    and consequently of losing <lb/>his power? Or is it likely that he would have
                    <lb/>greater influence with the superstitious crowd, <lb/>than he, who was
                    deemed of skill to bend to his <lb/>purpose the demons that sway the fortune of
                    <lb/>mankind?&#x2013;Another question concenring O<lb break="no"/>nonthio, and
                    we leave him. Is it consistent with <lb/>the phlisophic firmness of the Sachem,
                    so to de<lb break="no"/>spair on receiving news of his son's death, as to
                    <lb/>declare that he should know no comfort, but to <lb/>die? or is it
                    consistent with his humanity to leave <lb/>Maraino at such a period of distress,
                    when she most <lb/>stood in need of his kind offices?&#x2013;The first, and
                    <lb/>best supported character in the piece is that of <lb/>Maraino. Her mind
                    seems intended as the seat <lb/>of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence
                    <lb/>of Ononthio, her unaffected piety, and her huma<lb break="no"/>nity, in
                    intfering to save an unknown captive <lb/>from death, are pleasing
                        <supplied>???</supplied> which give <supplied>???</supplied>
                    <lb/>an insight into her nature. In the breast of Ma<lb break="no"/>riano every
                    thing is subordinate to her love for <lb/>Onaiyo: this leading feature in her
                    caracter is <lb/>properly kept in view during the course of the <lb/>piece. But
                    even in this master-piece the author, <lb/>has, perhaps, once deviated a little
                    from nature. <lb/>The sentiments Maraino utters during the con<lb break="no"
                    />versation with Sydney, in the fifth act, are rather <lb/>those of a Phiosopher
                    and Divine, than a young <lb/>creature, the chorus of whole heart are tuned to
                    <lb/>the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can <lb/>she, who had lately
                    discovered a long lost brother, <lb/>talk so coldly in his presence; Can she,
                    who had <lb/>so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband, <lb/>so
                    entirely banish his imag from her mind, as to <lb/>converse on matters so
                    indifferent? Can the gen<lb break="no"/>tle Maraino become the cold
                    moralist?&#x2013;With this <lb/>one exception, the part of which we are speaking
                    <lb/>is finely drawn and highly intersting.&#x2013;The lan<lb break="no"/>guage
                    of the piece is every where elegant, and in <lb/>many places, where the
                    sentiment requires it, <lb/>sublime. The uathor has requently dignified his
                    <lb/>verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this <lb/>in general produces
                    a good effect&#x2013;but there is a <lb/>danger of using them too often, and of
                    chusing <lb/>them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult <lb/>talk where
                    all is so excellent, to refer to any par<lb break="no"/>ticular passage of scene
                    as deserving most notice: <lb/>it requires no small degree of taste and
                    judgement. <lb/>If there is any preference to be given, it is per<lb break="no"
                    />haps to that scene in the 2d act, where Onaiyo <lb/>gives an account of the
                    battle at Quebec; and <lb/>the scene in the 4th act, where Maraino is prompt<lb
                        break="no"/>ed by Neidan to slay her brother,&#x2013;who proves <lb/>his
                    innocence by the production of her husband's <lb/>belt, the sight of which draws
                    an elegant speech <lb/>from the enraptured fair. This scene, however, <lb/>would
                    be improved did it conclude with some<lb break="no"/>thing more apt to the
                    joyful moment, than the so<lb break="no"/>lemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech
                    excellent in <lb/>itself, and containing a very fine sentiment, <lb/><hi
                        rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Sed nunc non erat his
                        locus.&#x2013;</hi></hi></p>
                <p>Upon the whole, the tragedy, upon which we <lb/>have, guided by impartiality,
                    spoken so freely, is <lb/>in our opinion far superior to most of those plays
                    <lb/>which have appeared of late years:&#x2013;it is devoid <lb/>of
                    bombast:&#x2013;it is nature&#x2013;and she must inevita<lb break="no"/>bly
                    please.</p>

                <p><pb/>Advice from Charlestown, South Carolina, <lb/>says that the Indians in
                    Washington county com<lb break="no"/>mit the most horrid depredations and
                    cruelties. <lb/>They have set fire to several houses; and a wo<lb break="no"
                    />man, who had a sick husband, telling them from <lb/>a window, of her calamity,
                    they shot her dead on <lb/>the spot, and then set fire to the spot. The sick
                    <lb/>man was consequently burnt.</p>
                <p>A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and <lb/>distinguished himself in opposing
                    the Indians on <lb/>a part of the American frontiers. This gentle<lb break="no"
                    />man, with two hundred men, even went into the <lb/>very heart of an Indian
                    settlement, and defeated <lb/>the savages. He then penetrated the country,
                    <lb/>destroying all before him, and returned without <lb/>the loss of a man.
                    Every possible acknowledge<lb break="no"/>ment was made of his services and
                    bravery, and <lb/>a liberal subscription made for his gallant little
                    <lb/>army.</p>

                    Montreal, conveyed let<lb break="no"/>ters to several gentlemen in town, all

                <p>"<hi rend="smallcaps">SIR</hi>, <lb/>"I have to inform you by several letters
                        re<lb break="no"/>ceived here on Saturday from Detroit, "we are
                    <lb/>informed the Americans, under General Sinclair, <lb/>had been twice
                    defeated, about the 19th ult. with <lb/>the loss of from 500 to 600 men, by the
                    Indians <lb/>The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse <lb/>which they had
                    drawn into a snare, and cut the <lb/>whole of them off. In a second engagement,
                    they <lb/>were likewise victorious, having nearly killed as <lb/>many. On
                    account of which, Sinclair thought <lb/>proper to retreat; and the last accounts
                    state the <lb/>Indians having divided themselves into small par<lb break="no"
                    />ties, had so harrassed him, that he was obliged to <lb/>leave the wounded in
                    the field&#x2013;Sinclair lost his <lb/>artillery, a cohorn, and grass-hopper.
                    It is said <lb/>the Indians are very much elated at their success, <lb/>and that
                    numbers were daily joining them, at <lb/>their head quarters, about the Maimis
                    towns&#x2013; <lb/>One Indian, it is said, killed 30 with his own <lb/>hand.</p>
                <p>"The Indians were extremely civil to the <lb/>traders from Detriot, having
                    assisted them, when <lb/>they knew of the approach of the Americans, to
                    <lb/>remove their property to safety, except ammuni<lb break="no"/>tion and
                    arms. These are facts so well ascertain<lb break="no"/>ed, that there does not
                    remain the least doubt <lb/>of them:</p>
                <p>They may be attended with very serious and <lb/>important consequences to the
                    province, as I dare <lb/>say, all will be imputed to the British for supply<lb
                        break="no"/>ing these Indians with arms and ammunition.&#x2013; <lb/>In
                    short, I would not be surprized to hear of an <lb/>American army raising, to
                    attack this country. <lb/>* The loss is here specified, but other letters
                    differing <lb/>in number, we shall only say, the estimate in general <lb/>does
                    not appear considerable.</p>

                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">dred and fourteen years</hi>. Scotland was the place
                    <lb/>of his nativity; he remembers having seen King <lb/>William III. and was
                    present at the two succeed<lb break="no"/>ing coronations. Neither his memory
                    nor his <lb/>sight, are in the least impaired; and such is his <lb/>strength,
                    that after working all the week at his <lb/>profession, he regularly walks on
                    Sunday to Phila<lb break="no"/>delphia, and back. His third wife is now living,
                    <lb/>nd is not more than thirty years old.</p>

                <p><pb n="3"/> CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</p>
                <p>The following account of the inhabitants of this <lb/>settlement is given by a
                    late traveller.</p>
                <p>The education of youth has hitherto been very <lb/>much neglected: the government
                    never hit upon any <lb/>successful plan for the establishment of public schools; <cb/>
                    <lb/>and the individual had no other ambition but that of <lb/>qualifying his
                    sons, by writing and accounts, to be<lb break="no"/>come servants of the
                    Company. This body of mer<lb break="no"/>chants had a number of persons in their
                    employ, <lb/>who were very ill paid. Their salaries, indeed, were
                    <lb/>sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the <lb/>consequence of
                    such a conduct was, that each be<lb break="no"/>came a kind of petty dealer.
                    Each had his little pri<lb break="no"/>vate shop in some corner of his house.
                    The most pal<lb break="no"/>try articles were in the list of their commodities
                    for <lb/>sale ; and those who ranked high in government, <lb/>and assumed a
                    string of full-founding epithets to <lb/>their names, felt no sore of indignity
                    in retailing the <lb/>produce of their gardens ; not indeed, avowedly, but
                    <lb/>through the medium of their slaves. In fact, the minds <lb/>of every class,
                    the Governor, the Clergy, the F[?]l, <lb/>and the Secretary of the Court of
                    Justice excepted, <lb/>were wholly bent on trade. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Knopman</hi>, or merchant, <lb/>was a title that conferred rank at the Cape, to
                    which <lb/>the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas <lb/>of the
                    Dutch differ widely from those of the Chi<lb break="no"/>nese, who have degraded
                    the merchant into the <lb/>very lowest order of their society.</p>
                <p>That portion of the day, not employed in the <lb/>concerns of trade, is usually
                    devoted to the grati<lb break="no"/>fication of the sensual appetite. Few have
                    any taste <lb/>for reading, and none for the cultivation of the fine
                    <lb/>arts.&#x2013;They have no kind of public amusements, <lb/>except occasional
                    balls ; nor is there much social <lb/>intercourse but by family parties; which
                    usually <lb/>consist of card playing or dancing. Money-mat<lb break="no"/>ters
                    and merchandize engross their whole conver<lb break="no"/>sation : yet none are
                    opulent, though many in easy <lb/>circumstances. There are no beggars in the
                    whole <lb/>colony, and but a few who are objects of public cha<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the <lb/>interest of a fund
                    established out of the church su<lb break="no"/>perfluities, from alms,
                    donations, and collections, <lb/>made after divine service, and not from any tax
                    laid <lb/>upon the public. Except, indeed, a few colonial <lb/>assessments for
                    the repairs of the streets and public <lb/>works, the inhabitants of the Cape
                    have little <lb/>drawback on their profits, on the produce of their
                    <lb/>labour.</p>
                <p>It has been the remark of most travellers, that <lb/>the ladies of the Cape are
                    pretty, lively, and good <lb/>humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic
                        tem<lb break="no"/>per which is a principal trait in the national charac<lb
                        break="no"/>ter of the Dutch. The difference in the manners <lb/>and
                    appearance of the young men and the young <lb/>women, in the same family, is
                    inconceivably great. <lb/>The former are clumsy in their shape, awkward in
                    <lb/>in their carriage, and of an unsocial disposition; <lb/>whilst the latter
                    are generally of a small, delicate <lb/>form, below the middle size, of easy and
                    unaffected <lb/>manners, well dressed, and fond of social intercourse; <lb/>an
                    indulgence in which they are seldom restrained <lb/>by their parents, and which
                    they as seldom turn to <lb/>abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on,
                    <lb/>and less subject to, the caprice of parents than else <lb/>where.
                    Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; <lb/>but all the children, male and
                    female, share alike <lb/>in the family property. No parent can disinherit a
                    <lb/>child without assigning, on proof, on at least of <lb/>the fourteen reasons
                    enumerated in the Justinian <lb/>Code.</p>
                <p>By the law of the colony, a community of all <lb/>property, both real and
                    personal, is supposed to take <lb/>place on the marriage of two person unless
                    the <lb/>contrary should be particularly provided against by <lb/>solemn
                    contract made before marriage. Where no <lb/>such contract exists, the children,
                    on the death of <lb/>either parent, are entitled to that half of the joint
                    <lb/>property, which was supposed to belong to the de<lb break="no"/>ceased, and
                    which cannot be withheld on applica<lb break="no"/>tion after they are come of
                    age.</p>
                <p>It is but justice to the young females of the Cape <lb/>to r emark, that many of
                    them have profited much <lb/>more than could be expected from the limited
                    <lb/>means of education that the place affords. In the <lb/>better families,
                    most of them are taught music, and <lb/>some have acquired a tolerable degree of
                    execution. <lb/>Many understand the French language, and some <lb/>have made
                    great proficiency in the English. They <pb n="4"/> are expert at the needle, and
                    all kinds of lace, knot<lb break="no"/>ting, and tambour work, and in general
                    make up <lb/>their own dresses, following the prevailing fashion <lb/>of England
                    brought from time to time by the female <lb/>passengers bound to India, from
                    whom they may <lb/>be said to <lb/><hi rend="center">"Catch the manners living
                        as they rise"</hi></p>
                <p>Neither are the other sex, while boys, deficient <lb/>in vivacity or talent ;
                    but, for want of the means of <lb/>a proper education, to open their minds, and
                    excite <lb/>in them a desire of knowledge, they soon degene<lb break="no"/>rate
                    into the common routine of eating, smoaking [sic], <lb/>and sleeping. Few of the
                    male inhabitants associate <lb/>with the English, except such as hold
                    employments <lb/>under the Government. This backwardness may <lb/>be said to be
                    owing in part to the different habits of <lb/>the two nations, and partly,
                    perhaps, to the reluc<lb break="no"/>tance that a vanquished people must always
                    feel in <lb/>mixing with their conquerors.</p>

                <p><pb/>As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at <lb/>the opening of the
                    Congress of the United <lb/>States at New York, Nov. 6 1792, gives an
                    <lb/>impartial account of the situation of tha coun<lb break="no"/>try, we are
                    persuaded it will be found not un<lb break="no"/>entertaining to our
                    readers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the <lb/>House of
                        Representatives, </hi>
                </p>
                <p>IT is some abatement of the satisfaction, with <lb/>which I meet you on the
                    present occasion, <lb/>that in felicitating you on a continuance of the
                    <lb/>national prosperity, generally, I am not able to <lb/>add to it information
                    that the Indian hostilities, <lb/>which have for some time past, distressed our
                    <lb/>western frontier, have terminated:</p>
                <p>You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less <lb/>concern, than I communicate
                    it, that reiterated <lb/>endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have
                    <lb/>hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs <lb/>of persevering
                    hostility on the part of the tribes <lb/>with whom we are in contest. An earnest
                    desire <lb/>to procure tranquillity to the frontier&#x2013;to stop <lb/>the
                    further effusion of blood&#x2013;to arrest the pro<lb break="no"/>gress of
                    expense&#x2013;to forward the prevalent wish of <lb/>the nation, for peace, has
                    led to strenuous efforts, <lb/>through various channels, to accomplish these
                        de<lb break="no"/>sirable purposes:&#x2013;In making which efforts, I
                    <lb/>consulted less my own anticipations of the event, <lb/>or the scruples
                    which some considerations were <lb/>calculated to inspire, than the wish to find
                    the ob<lb break="no"/>ject attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, that
                    <lb/>such is the case.</p>
                <p>A detail of the measures which have been pur<lb break="no"/>sued, and of their
                    consequences, which will be <lb/>laid before you, while it will confirm to you
                    the <lb/>want of success, thus far, will, I trust, evince <lb/>that means, as
                    proper and as efficacious, as could <lb/>have been devised have been employed.
                    The <lb/>issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; <lb/>but a favorable
                    one, though not to be despaired <lb/>of, is not promised by anything that has
                    yet hap<lb break="no"/>pened.</p>
                <p>In the course of the attempts, which have been <lb/>made some valuable citizens
                    have fallen victims <lb/>to their zeal for the public service. A sanction
                    <lb/>commonly respected, even among savages, has been <lb/>found, in this
                    instance, insufficient to protect <lb/>from massacre the emissaries of peace; it
                    will, I <cb/>
                    <lb/>presume, be duly considered whether the occasion <lb/>does not call for an
                    exercise of liberality towards <lb/>the families of the deceased.</p>
                <p>It must add to your concern, to be informed <lb/>that besides the continuation of
                    hostile appearances <lb/>among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threat<lb
                        break="no"/>ening symptoms have of late been revived among <lb/>some of
                    those south of it.</p>
                <p>A part of the Cherokees, known by the name <lb/>of Chickamagas, inhabiting five
                    villages on the <lb/>Tennessee River, have long been in the practice of
                    <lb/>committing depredations on the neighbouring <lb/>settlements.</p>
                <p>It was hoped that the treaty of Holston, made <lb/>with the Cherokee Nation in
                    July 1791, would <lb/>have prevented a repetition of such depredations. <lb/>But
                    the event has not answered this hope. The <lb/>Chickamagas, aided by some
                    banditti of another <lb/>tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated
                    <lb/>wanton and unprovoked hostilities, upon the ci<lb break="no"/>tizens of the
                    United States in that quarter. The <lb/>information which has been received on
                    this sub<lb break="no"/>ject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive pre<lb
                        break="no"/>cautions only have been enjoined and observed.</p>
                <p>It is not understood that any breach of treaty <lb/>or aggression whatsoever, on
                    the part of the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States or their citizens, is even
                    alleged, as <lb/>a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.</p>
                <p>I have reason to believe, that every practicable <lb/>exertion has been made
                    (pursuant to the provision <lb/>by law for that purpose) to be prepared for
                    <lb/>the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the <lb/>event of a failure
                    of pacific overtures. A large <lb/>proportion of the troops authorized to be
                    raised <lb/>have been recruited, though the number is still <lb/>incomplete, and
                    pains have been taken to disci<lb break="no"/>pline and put them in condition
                    for the particu<lb break="no"/>lar kind of service to be performed. A delay of
                    <lb/>operations (besides being dictated by the measures <lb/>which were pursuing
                    towards a pacific termina<lb break="no"/>tion of the war) has been in itself
                    deemed prefe<lb break="no"/>rable to immature efforts. A statement, from the
                    <lb/>proper department, with regard to the number <lb/> of troops raised, and
                    some other points which <lb/>have been suggested, will afford more precise in<lb
                        break="no"/>formation as a guide to the legislative consultations <lb/>and
                    among other things, will enable Congress to <lb/>judge whether some additional
                    stimulus to the re<lb break="no"/>cruiting service may not be advisable.</p>
                <p>In looking forward to the future expense of <lb/>the operations which may be
                    found inevitable, I <lb/>derive consolation from the information I receive
                    <lb/>that the product of the revenues for the present <lb/>year, is likely to
                    supersede the necessity of addi<lb break="no"/>tional burthens on the community,
                    for the service <lb/>of the ensuing year. This however, will be bet<lb
                        break="no"/>ter ascertained in the course of the session; and it <lb/>is
                    proper to add, that the information alluded to <lb/>proceeds upon the
                    supposition of no material ex<lb break="no"/>tension of the spirit of
                    hostilities.</p>
                <p>I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, <lb/>without again recommending
                    to your considera<lb break="no"/>tion the expediency of more adequate provision
                    <lb/>for giving energy to the laws throughout our in<lb break="no"/>terior
                    frontier; and for restraining the commission <lb/>of outrages upon the Indians;
                    without which all <lb/>pacific plans must prove nugatory&#x2013;To enable by
                    <lb/>competent rewards, the employment of qualified <lb/>and trusty persons to
                    reside among them, as agents, <lb/>would also contribute to the preservation of
                    peace <lb/>and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these <lb/>expedients, an
                    eligible plan could be devised for <lb/>promoting civilization among the
                    friendly tribes, <lb/>and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale
                    <lb/>equal to their wants, and under regulations calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to
                    protect them from imposition and extor<lb break="no"/>tion, its influence in
                    cementing their interest <lb/>with ours could not but be considerable.</p>
                <p>The prosperous state of our revenue has been <lb/>intimated&#x2013;This would be
                    still more the case, <lb/>were it not for the impediments which in some <cb/>
                    <lb/>places continue to embarrass the collection of the <lb/>duties on spirits,
                    distilled within the United States. <lb/>These impediments have lessened, and
                    are lessened <lb/>in local extent; and as applied to the community <lb/>at
                    large, the contentment with the law appears <lb/>to be progressive.</p>
                <p>But symptoms of increased opposition having <lb/>lately manifested themselves in
                    certain quarters, <lb/>I judged a special interposition on my part, proper
                    <lb/>and advisable, and under this impression have <lb/>issued a proclamation
                    warning against all unlaw<lb break="no"/>ful combinations and proceedings,
                    having for their <lb/>object or tending to obstruct the operation of <lb/>the
                    law in question, and announcing that all law<lb break="no"/>ful ways and means
                    would be strictly put in exe<lb break="no"/>cution for bringing to justice the
                    infractors there<lb break="no"/>of and securing obedience thereto.</p>
                <p>Measures have also been taken for the prosecu<lb break="no"/>tion of offenders.
                    And Congress may be assured <lb/>that nothing within constitutional and legal
                    limits <lb/>which may depend upon me, shall be wanting to as<lb break="no"/>sert
                    and maintain the just authority of the laws. <lb/>In fulfilling this trust, I
                    shall count entirely upon <lb/>the full cooperation of the other departments of
                    <lb/>the Government and upon the zealous support of <lb/>all good citizens.</p>
                <p>I can not forbear to bring again into the view <lb/>of the Legislature the
                    subject of a revision of the <lb/>judiciary system. A representation from the
                        jud<lb break="no"/>ges of the supreme court, which will be laid be<lb
                        break="no"/>fore you, points out some of the inconveniences <lb/>that are
                    experienced. In the course of the execu<lb break="no"/>tion of the laws
                    considerations rise out of the <lb/>structure of the system, which in some
                    cases, tend <lb/>to relax their efficacy. As connected with this <lb/>subject,
                    provisions to facilitate the taking of bail <lb/>upon processes out of the
                    courts of the United <lb/>States, and a supplementary definition of offenses
                    <lb/>against the constitution and laws of the union, and <lb/>of the punishment
                    for such offenses will, it is pre<lb break="no"/>sumed, be found worthy of
                    particular attention.</p>
                <p>Observations on the value of peace with other <lb/>nations are unnecessary. It
                    would be wise, how<lb break="no"/>ever, by timely provisions to guard against
                    those <lb/>acts of our own citizens which might tend to dis<lb break="no"/>turb
                    it, and to put ourselves in a condition to <lb/>give that satisfaction to
                    foreign nations, which we <lb/>may sometimes have occasion to require from them.
                    <lb/>I particularly recommend to your consideration of <lb/>the means of
                    preventing those aggressions by our <lb/>citizens on the territory of other
                    nations, and <lb/>other infractions of the law of nations, which <lb/>furnishes
                    just subject of complaint, might endan<lb break="no"/>ger our peace with them.
                    And, in general, the <lb/>maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign
                    <lb/>powers will be presented to your attention by the <lb/>expiration of the
                    law for that purpose, which takes <lb/>place, if not renewed, at the close of
                    the present <lb/>session.</p>
                <p>In execution of the authority given by the le<lb break="no"/>gislature, measures
                    have been taken for engaging <lb/>some artists from abroad to aid in the
                        establish<lb break="no"/>ment of our mint; others have been employed at
                    <lb/>home. Provision has been made of the requisite <lb/>buildings, and these
                    are now putting into proper <lb/>condition for the purposes of the
                    establishment. <lb/>There has also been a small beginning in the coin<lb
                        break="no"/>age of half dimes, the want of small coins in cir<lb break="no"
                    />culation calling the first attention to them.</p>
                <p>The regulation of foreign coins in correspon<lb break="no"/>dency with the
                    principles of our national coinage, <lb/>as being essential to their due
                    operation, and to <lb/>order in our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be
                    <lb/>resumed and completed.</p>
                <p>It is represented that some provisions in the <lb/>law, which establishes the
                    Post-Office, operate, <lb/>in experiment, against the transmission of news<lb
                        break="no"/>papers to distant parts of the country.&#x2013;Should <lb/>this,
                    upon due enquiry, be found to be the fact, <lb/>a full conviction of the
                    importance of facilitating <lb/>the circulation of political intelligence and
                        infor<lb break="no"/></p>
                <p><pb/>mation, will, I doubt not, lead to the application <lb/>of a remedy.</p>
                <p>The adoption of a constitution for the state of <lb/>Kentucky, has been notified
                    to me. The legis<lb break="no"/>lature will share with me in the satisfaction
                    which <lb/>arises from an event interesting to the happiness <lb/>of the part of
                    the nation to which it relates, and <lb/>conducive to the general order.</p>
                <p>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since <lb/>my last communication on the
                    subject, and in <lb/>further execution of the acts, severally making
                    <lb/>provision for the public debt, and for the reduc<lb break="no"/>tion
                    thereof, three new loans have been effected, <lb/>each for three millions of
                    florins,&#x2013;one at Ant<lb break="no"/>werp, at the annual interest of four
                    and one-half <lb/>per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in <lb/>lieu of
                    all charges.&#x2013;The rates of these loans, and <lb/>the circumstances under
                    which they have been <lb/>made are confirmations of the high state of our
                    <lb/>credit abroad.</p>
                <p>Among the objects to which these funds have <lb/>been directed to be applied, the
                    payment of the <lb/>debts due to certain foreign officers, according to <lb/>the
                    provision made during the last session, has <lb/>been embraced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</hi>,</p>
                <p>I entertain a strong hope, that the state of the <lb/>national finances is now
                    sufficiently matured to <lb/>enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>tual arrangement for the regular redemption and <lb/>discharge of the
                    public debt, according to the <lb/>right which has been reserved to the
                    government <lb/>&#x2013;no measure can be more desirable, whether view<lb
                        break="no"/>ed with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to <lb/>the
                    general sentiment and wish of the nation.</p>
                <p>Provision is likewise requisite for the reimburse<lb break="no"/>ment of the loan
                    which has been made of the <lb/>Bank of the United States, pursuant to the
                        sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the act by which it is incorporated. <lb/>In
                    fulfilling the public stipulations, in this particular, <lb/>it is expected a
                    valuable saving will be made.</p>
                <p>Appropriations for the current service of the en<lb break="no"/>suing year and
                    for such extraordinaries as may <lb/>require provision, will demand, and I doubt
                    not <lb/>will engage, your early attention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of
                        Representatives</hi>,</p>
                <p>I content myself with recalling your attention, <lb/>generally to such objects,
                    not particularized in <lb/>my present, as have been suggested in my former
                    <lb/>communications to you.</p>
                <p>Various temporary laws will expire during the <lb/>present session. Among these,
                    that which regu<lb break="no"/>lates trade and intercourse with the Indian
                    tribes, <lb/>will merit particular notice.</p>
                <p>The results of your common deliberations hi<lb break="no"/>therto will, I trust,
                    be productive of solid and <lb/>durable advantages to our constituents; such as,
                    <lb/>by conciliating more and more their ultimate suf<lb break="no"/>frage, will
                    tend to strengthen and confirm their <lb/>attachment, upon which, under Divine
                    Providence, <lb/>materially depend their union, their safety, and <lb/>their
                    happiness.</p>
                <p>Still further to promote and secure these inesti<lb break="no"/>mable ends there
                    is nothing which can have a <lb/>more powerful tendency, than the careful
                        culti<lb break="no"/>vation of harmony, combined with a due regard <lb/>to
                    stability, in the public councils.</p>

                    that <lb/>have lately taken place in this district. The <lb/>Indians have killed
                    and scalped a great number of <lb/>persons, among whom is Colonel Isaac Bledose,
                    <lb/>who was massacred within 150 yards of his own <lb/>house.</p>
                <p>On the 27th instant a body of Indians attacked <lb/>Greenfield station: they
                    killed John Jervis, and <lb/>a negro fellow, belonging to Mrs. Tarker. By
                    <lb/>the bravery of three young men, viz. William Nee<lb break="no"/>ly, William
                    Wilson, and William Hall, the station <lb/>was preserved; they killed two
                    Indians, wounded <lb/>several others, and put them to flight. It is to be <lb/>
                    remembered, that Neely and Hall had each lost a <lb/>father and two brothers,
                    and Wilson a brother, by <lb/>the savages. Men are now in pursuit of the Indi<lb

                <p>About the 5th instant, a company of seven men <lb/>were attacked on the trace
                    from Cumberland to <lb/>Kentucky, near Big Barren, by a party of Indi<lb

                    <lb/>Advices from our western frontiers mention, <lb/>that Major General Twiggs
                    crossed the Oconnee <lb/>with about 900 men, on Saturday last, on their <lb/>way
                    to the Cakmulgee, where the infantry were to <lb/>halt and build a fort. The
                    cavalry, amounting <lb/>to 450, commanded by Brigadier Generals Irwin,
                    <lb/>Clark, and Blackburn, were immediately to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed to the
                    lower Creek towns, and procure satis<lb break="no"/>faction for the numerous
                    unprovoked murders and <lb/>devastations lately committed by that faithless
                    tribe <lb/>of savages.</p>
                <p>Brigadier General Glascock, we are informed, <lb/>has received orders from the
                    Commander in Chief <lb/>to march to the frontiers in a few days, with one-
                    <lb/>third of his brigade, and part of the Augusta ar<lb break="no"/>tillery.

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">New South Wales</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The following particulars respecting this flou<lb break="no"/>rishing colony will
                    not be unacceptable to our <lb/>readers :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"We are informed by Lieutenant Grant, <lb/>who is lately arrived from New South
                    Wales, <lb/>of the flourishing state of that colony ; he left <lb/>Port Jackson
                    in Novemeber last, when the crops <lb/>were very luxuriant and beginning to be
                    cut <lb/>down, without having suffered that year from <lb/>the floods.</p>
                <p>"Governor King had opened a communica<lb break="no"/>tion with Oraheire, for the
                    purpose of supplying <lb/>the colony with pork, in which he had been
                    <lb/>singularly successful his Majesty's armed ship <lb/>Porpoise having made
                    one trip, and the Norfolk <lb/>brig having failed on the same employ previous
                    <lb/>to Mr Grant's leaving Sydney.</p>
                <p>"The most friendly understanding exists be<lb break="no"/>tween the natives of
                    Otaheite and the settle<lb break="no"/>ment of New South Wales. We are happy to
                    <lb/>hear that the latter country is longer in want <lb/>of a stape commodity,
                    the article of coals, of an <lb/>excellent kind, being found in abundance in
                    <lb/>Hunter's River, together with plenty of wood, <lb/>well qualified for the
                    masting of shipping. Mr <lb/>Grant made his passage to the Cape of Good
                    <lb/>Hope, round Cape Horn, in the brig Anna Jo<lb break="no"/>sepha, loaded
                    with spars for masts, and coals, <lb/>which latter sold immediately at the Cape,
                    at <lb/>36 rix dollars per ton (nearly 6l. sterling.)</p>
                <p>"Governor King had formed a small settle<lb break="no"/>ment at Hunter's River,
                    for the purpose of work<lb break="no"/>ing the coal, which is of the same nature
                    with <lb/>that of Newcastle.</p>
                <p>"Mr Grant entered this river in the Lady <lb/>Nelson, in order to obtain the
                    survey of it. He <lb/>pentrated in his boats nearly seventy miles up <lb/>the
                    same, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel <lb/>Paterson, without being able at
                    that time, to <lb/>discover its source. A wood resembling sustic[?[ <lb/>had
                    also been found.</p>
                <p>"Mr Grant in his passage from England to <lb/>Port Jackson, in the Lady Nelson, a
                    vessel of <lb/>only 60 tons burthen, with three sliding keels, <lb/>and built on
                    Captain Schank's construction, was <lb/>the first that passed through the
                    straits which se<lb break="no"/>parate Van Diemens Land from New Holland,
                    <lb/>and sailed along a great extent of coast to the <lb/>westward of any land
                    before seen by those who <lb/>had visited that country, going into no higher
                    <lb/>latitude than 39. 30. fourth ; and observes, that <lb/>the fourth cape of
                    New Holland lies in 39. 2. <lb/>fourth. He found those he sailed along bold,
                    <lb/>with very deep water, wherever he attempted to <lb/>land ; and, in general,
                    he had, with a very mo<lb break="no"/>derate offing, from 50 10 45, and 30
                    fathoms <lb/>water, fine land, and sometimes shells.</p>
                <p>"By order of Governor King, he returned <lb/>into those straits, and obtained the
                    survey of the <lb/>coast from Wilson's Promontory to Western <lb/>Port, with the
                    survey of that harbour, which is <lb/>well sheltered, and capable of containing
                    many <lb/>sail of shipping. There is abundance of wood <lb/>easily to be got,
                    and plenty of water ; though the <lb/>latter is rather difficult to be procured,
                    on ac<lb break="no"/>count of the distance, and from several shoals <lb/>lying
                    in the way, which render it necessary to <lb/>take advantage of tide. Mr Grant
                    gives a very <lb/>favourable report of that part of the country.</p>

                <p>"<hi rend="smallcaps">Quebec</hi>, March 23, 1810.&#x2013;A number of
                    <lb/>leading characters among the Canadians, who were <lb/>Members of the House
                    of Assembly (twice dissol<lb break="no"/>ved for improper conduct) and the
                    proprietor of a <lb/>French paper, called <hi rend="italic">La Canadien</hi>,
                    have been arrest<lb break="no"/>ed and thrown into jail, upon a charge of
                        treason<lb break="no"/>able and seditious practises ; the printing press,
                    types, <lb/>&amp;c. also taken possession of. This vigorous mea<lb break="no"
                    />sure of Sir James Craig, has astonished the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians not a
                    little, but the consequences will be no <lb/>doubt beneficial to the country, as
                    it has crushed a <lb/>faction which has for some years been gaining
                    <lb/>strength, and acquiring dangerous ingluence over the <lb/>minds of the
                    inhabitants, who are without education, <lb/>and ignorant, of course, in the
                    extreme ; therefore <lb/>easily misled by demagogues among their country<lb
                        break="no"/>men, who seize every opportunity of stirring up all <lb/>those
                    prejudices which the people of this country <lb/>naturally have against the
                    British : for, having been <lb/>allowed to preserve their language, they are
                    nearly <lb/>as much Frenchmen now as they were at the con<lb break="no"
                    />quest."</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Quebec</hi>, March 22.&#x2013;On Sunday afternoon, the
                    <lb/>printer of the <hi rend="italic">Canadien</hi>, Mr Charles Lafrancois
                    <lb/>was arrested and committed to jail, under a warrant <lb/>from the Executive
                    Council, on a charge of treason<lb break="no"/>able practises. On Monday
                    evening, Dr Blanchet <lb/>and Mr Bedard, and last evening Mr T. Taschereau,
                    <lb/>were also arrested, and committed by the same au<lb break="no"/>thority on
                    the same charges.</p>
                <p>The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an e<lb break="no"/>legant dinner, at
                    head-quarters, on the 4th curt. to <lb/>celebrate the King's
                    birthday-day&#x2013;at which several of <lb/>the Nobility and Gentry, Generals,
                    and Field-Offi<lb break="no"/>cers of the army, were present.</p>
                <p>Among the other accidents that occurred on the <lb/>King's birth-day, from the
                    imprudent use of gun<lb break="no"/>powder, is the death of girl in Richmond
                    Street.&#x2013; <lb/>Her clothes were set fire by a squib, and, al<lb break="no"
                    />though immediately taken to the Infirmary, was so <lb/>severely burnt, that
                    she died before morning.</p>
                <p>A very melancholy accident happened at a place <lb/>called the Pease,
                    Berwickshire. As one of the bag<lb break="no"/>gage carts of the Forfarshire
                    militia was stopping <lb/>there, a fine boy about eight years of age, belonging
                    <lb/>to Serjeant-Major Nicol, got out of the cart, and <lb/>was climbing on the
                    wheel, when the horses sudden<lb break="no"/>going off, threw him on the ground,
                    and the <lb/>wheel passing over his body, crushed him to death. <lb/>The
                    unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this <lb/>unhappy accident
                    happened.</p>
                <p>On Thursday night, a spirit shop in Gibson-street, <lb/>Glasgow, was broken into
                    and about five pounds <lb/>in silver, a seven shilling piece, about eight
                    shillings <lb/>of copper, a counterfeit half-guinea, and a poc<lb break="no"
                    />ket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; <lb/>some partial payments
                    are marked on the bills. The <lb/>villians appear to have entered the shop by
                    forcing <lb/>up the window shutter with an iron bar, and then <lb/>breaking a
                    pane of glass, by which they got the iron <lb/>bolts and the window opened.</p>
                <p>On Sturday last, a porter was killed in the hold <lb/>of a vessel in Dundee
                    harbour. He was engaged <lb/>unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron
                        pul<lb break="no"/>ly was supported, giving way, the measure fell down
                    <lb/>upon him, and killed him instantly.</p>
                <p>A few days ago, a mason, of the name of Steven<lb break="no"/>son, was killed by
                    the blowing up of some stones, at <lb/>Templeton, in the parish of Auchterhouse.
                    The <lb/>match unfortunately communicated too early to the <lb/>powder, and the
                    explosion took place before he <lb/>could get out of the way. He has left a wife
                    and <lb/>two children to lament his loss.</p>

                    may receive of it, we consider it a dury, we <lb/>owe to the community at large
                    in this country, to <lb/>state the circumstances as they occurred, in a fair,
                    <lb/>open, and candid manner.</p>
                <p>By the late militia law, 2000 young men are to be <lb/>drafted from the general
                    militia of the province for <lb/>three months to be properly trained, and of
                    course, <lb/>a certain proportion of this number is to be furnished <lb/>by each
                    particular district. Some those drafted <lb/>from the Parish of Pointe Claire
                    refused to march to <lb/>Lapraire, for the purpose of joining the divion sta<lb
                        break="no"/>tioned there ; in consequence of which, Major, Lep<lb break="no"
                    />rohon, belonging to this particular battalion, was sent <lb/>on Tuesday last,
                    with 22 attendants, to apprehend <lb/>these refractory persons as deserters.</p>
                <p>They apprehended four with some opposition ; and <lb/>on their way to town with
                    them, they were follow<lb break="no"/>ed by a considerable number of persons who
                    rescued <lb/>one prisoner, and threatened that they would next <lb/>day proceed
                    to the depot at Lapraire, and bring <lb/>away by force from thence the young men
                    of the <lb/>parish, who were there on duty. Accordingly, on <lb/>Wednesday, a
                    large body of these people assembled <lb/>at La Chine, with the intention of
                    carrying their <lb/>threats into execution.</p>
                <p>Thomas M'Cord, Esq. one of the Police Magi<lb break="no"/>strates, about four
                    o'clock in the afternoon, left town, <lb/>accompanied by the light infantry of
                    the 49th regi<lb break="no"/>ment, and a detachment of the royal artillery, with
                    <lb/>two field-pieces, under the command of Major <lb/>Plenderleath, and took
                    post on a point opposite to <lb/>the insurgents (consisting of about 400
                    persons, 87 <lb/>of whom appeared to be armed) and at the distance[?] <lb/>of
                    about two acres. Mr M'Cord, with some other <lb/>respectable citizens, pointed
                    out the impropriety of <lb/>their conduct, and the fate that would unfortunately
                    <lb/>await their perseverance ; urging them, by every per<lb break="no"
                    />suasion, to disperse and return peaceably to their horses <lb/>and obey the
                    law.</p>
                <p>They replied, that they did not consider the mi<lb break="no"/>litia bill as
                    fully passed&#x2013;that they were informed it <lb/>had not received the Royal
                    sanction ; and that al<lb break="no"/>though it might have passed the House of
                        Assem<lb break="no"/>bly, where it originated, it had not obtained the ap<lb
                        break="no"/>probation of the other branches of the Legislate ; <lb/>that the
                    law, if really enacted, had not been proma<lb break="no"/>gated amongst them,
                    and that they were not properly <lb/>made acquainted with it ; as such, they
                    could not <lb/>pay obedience to it.</p>
                <p>Under this false and unfortunate impression, these <lb/>deluded people persisted
                    ; but at the same time de<lb break="no"/>clared, with shouts of <hi
                        rend="italic">Vive le Roi</hi> that if the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment wanted
                    their services at any time, they were <lb/>ready, one and all, to come forward
                    with their lives <lb/>in the defence of their country, and that they would
                    <lb/>prove themselves, in the hour of danger, to be faithful <lb/>subjects to a
                    Government to which they were firmly <lb/>attached by every principle.</p>
                <p>Finding, however, that they still persisted in their <lb/>determination on this
                    particular object, Mr M'Cord, <lb/>in his Magisterial capacity, read the riot
                    act to them <lb/>and ordered them to disperse ; which not being com<lb
                        break="no"/>plied with, a round shot was fired by the artillery, <lb/>but
                    elevated above injury, which was returned by the <lb/>insurgents in a spirited
                    fire with ball, deserving of a <lb/>better cause. The troops then fired a volley
                    with ball <lb/>and grape, but still too much elevated to do any harm <lb/>which
                    was also returned by another discharge from <lb/>the mob, upon which a few
                    direct shots were fired <lb/>at them (it being nearly dark) by the military,
                    which <lb/>made them disperse, and one man was found killed <lb/>and another
                    wounded, it is feared mortally.</p>

                    <lb/>York, July, 28.</p>
                <p>Yesterday, at an early hour, his Honour, Isaac <lb/>Brock, Esq. administering the
                    Government of Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada, and Major-General, commanding his
                    <lb/>Majesty's forces therein, arrived at this place from <lb/>Fort-George, and
                    accompanied by a numerous suite <lb/>proceeded to the Government Building at
                    four <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi>
                    <lb/>when he opened the present extra session of the Le<lb break="no"
                    />gislature, and delivered the following speech to both <lb/>houses
                    :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature, Council <lb/>and Gentlemen of the House
                    of Assembly,</p>
                <p>"The urgency of the present crisis is the only considera<lb break="no"/>tion
                    which would have induced me to call you together, at a <lb/>time when public as
                    well as private duties elsewhere demand <lb/>your care and attention.</p>
                <p>"But, Gentlemen, when invaded by an enemy whose <lb/>avowed object is the entire
                    conquest of this province, the <lb/>voice of loyalty, as well as of interest,
                    calls aloud to every <lb/>person, in the sphere in which he is placed, to defend
                    his <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>"Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; <lb/>they have evinced,
                    by the promptitude and loyalty of their <lb/>conduct, that they are worthy of
                    the King whom they serve <lb/>and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it
                    affords me <lb/>particulary satisfaction, that, while I address you as
                        Legisla<lb break="no"/>tors, I speak to mean who, in the day of danger, will
                    be <lb/>ready to assist, not only with their counsels, but with their
                    <lb/>arms.</p>
                <p>"We look, Gentlemen, to our militia, as well as to the <lb/>regular forces, for
                    our protection ; but I should be wanting to <lb/>that important trust committed
                    to my care, if I attempted to <lb/>conceal (what experience, the great
                    instructor of mankind, <lb/>especially of legislators, has discovered) that
                    amendment <lb/>in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is
                    <lb/>for you to consider what further improvements they still may
                    <lb/>require.</p>
                <p>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, <lb/>and Gentlemen of the House
                    of Assembly,</p>
                <p>"From the history and experience of our mother country, <lb/>we learn, that in
                    times of actual invasion or interal commo<lb break="no"/>tion the ordinary
                    course of criminal laws has been found in <lb/>adequate to secure his Majesty's
                    Government from private <lb/>treachery, as well as from open disaffection ; and
                    that at such <lb/>times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws
                        re<lb break="no"/>straining, for a limited period, the liberty of
                    individuals, in <lb/>many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the
                        parti<lb break="no"/>culars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion
                    of the <lb/>province might justify me in the exercise of the full power re<lb
                        break="no"/>posed in me on such an emergency, yet it will be more agree<lb
                        break="no"/>able to me to receive the sanction of the Houses.</p>
                <p>"A few traitors have already joined the enemy&#x2013;have been <lb/>suffered to
                    come into the country with impunity&#x2013;and have <lb/>been harboured and
                    concealed in the interior ; yet the general <lb/>spirit of loyalty which appears
                    to pervade the inhabitants of <lb/>this province, is such as to authorise a just
                    expectation that <lb/>their efforts to mislead and deceive will be
                    unavailing&#x2013; <lb/>The disaffected, I am convinced, are few&#x2013;To
                    protect and <lb/>defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations, is an ob<lb
                        break="no"/>ject worthy of your most serious deliberations."</p>
                <p>The speech concludes with a call for supplies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Proclamation</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The unprovoked declaration of war by the United <lb/>States of America, against
                    the united kingdom of <lb/>Great Britain and Ireland, and its dependencies, has
                    <lb/>been followed by the actual invasion of this province <lb/>in a remote
                    frontier of the western disticts, by a <lb/>detachment of the United States. The
                    officer com<lb break="no"/>manding that detachment has thought proper to in<lb
                        break="no"/>vite his Majesty's subjects, not merely to a quiet and
                    <lb/>unresisting submission, but insults them with a call <lb/>to seek
                    voluntarily the protection of his Govern<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>Without condescending to repeat the illiberal <lb/>epithets bestowed in this
                    appeal of the American <lb/>Commander to the people of Upper Canada, on the
                    <lb/>administration of his Majesty, every inhabitant of <lb/>the province is
                    desired to seek the confutation of <lb/>such indecent slander in the review of
                    his own par<lb break="no"/>ticular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian sub<lb
                        break="no"/>ject, who can truly affirm to himself that he has <lb/>been
                    injured by the Government in his person, his <lb/>property, or his liberty?
                    Where is to be found, in <lb/>any part of the world, a growth so paid in pros<lb
                        break="no"/>perity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled <lb/>not
                    thirty years by a band of veterans, exiled from <lb/>their former possessions on
                    account of their loyalty, <lb/>not a descendant of these brave people it to be
                    found, <lb/>who, under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign, <lb/>has not
                    acquired a property and means of enjoyment, <lb/>superior to what were possessed
                    by their ancestors. <lb/>This unequalled prosperity would not have been at<lb
                        break="no"/>tained by the utmost liberality of the Government, <lb/>or the
                    persevering industry of the people, had not <lb/>the maritime power of the
                    mother country secured <lb/>to its colonists a safe access to every market where
                    <lb/>the produce of their labour was in request. The <lb/>unavoidable and
                    immediate consequence of a sepa<lb break="no"/>ration from Great Britain, must
                    be the loss of this <lb/>inestimable advantage, and what is offered to you in
                    <lb/>exchange? To become a territory of the United <lb/>States, and share with
                    them that exclusion from the <lb/>ocean which the policy of their Government
                        en<lb break="no"/>forces ; you are not even flattered with a participa<lb
                        break="no"/>tion of their boasted independence ; and it is but <lb/>too
                    obvious, that once exchanged from the power<lb break="no"/>ful protection of the
                    United Kingdom, you must be <lb/>re-annexed to the dominion of France, from
                    which <lb/>the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms <lb/>of Great
                    Britain at vast expence of blood and <lb/>treasure, from no other motive than to
                    relieve her <lb/>ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel
                    <lb/>neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire <lb/>of France, was the
                    stipulated reward for the aid af<lb break="no"/>forded to the revolted colonies,
                    now the United <lb/>States ; the debt is still due, and there can be no
                    <lb/>doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consi<lb break="no"/>deration
                    for commercial advantages, or rather for an <lb/>expected relaxation in the
                    tyranny of France over <lb/>the commercial world. Are you prepared, inhabit<lb
                        break="no"/>ants of Canada, to become willing subjects, or <lb/>rather
                    slaves to the despot who rules the nation of <lb/>Europe with a rod of iron? If
                    not, arise in a body, <lb/>exert your energies, co-operate cordially with the
                    <lb/>King's regular forces, to repel the invader, and do <lb/>not give cause to
                    your children, when groaning <lb/>under the oppression of a foreign master, to
                    reproach <lb/>you with having too easily parted with the richest in<lb
                        break="no"/>heritance of this earth&#x2013;a participation in the name,
                    <lb/>character, and freedom of Britain.</p>
                <p>[The proclamation concludes with a declaration, <lb/>that should the Americans
                    refused quarter in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of Indians being found in

                <p>This day at two o'clock, his Excellency the <lb/>Governor in Chief went in the
                    usual state to the <lb/>Legislative Council Chamber, and being seated on
                    <lb/>the Throne, the Gentlemen Usher of the Black <lb/>Rod was sent to command
                    the presence of the As<lb break="no"/>sembly, which being come up, the
                    Honourable <lb/>Speaker of the Assembly said&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"May it please your Excellency,</p>
                <p>"His Majesty's faithful subjects, the representatives of <lb/>the province of
                    Lower Canada, have passed a bill, intituled, <lb/>"An Act of facilitate the
                    Circulation of Army Bills." Their <lb/>loyalty, and the happiness of this
                    province in being connected <lb/>with, and powerfully protected by the British
                    nation, are the <lb/>basis of their constitution, and the just grounds which
                    gave <lb/>rise to the formation of the militia, and the firm determina<lb
                        break="no"/>tion to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust
                    <lb/>war that the United States have lately declared ; they are, <lb/>therefore,
                    under the greatest obligation to your Excellency <lb/>for having communicated to
                    them your wise precautions, on <lb/>the means to ameliorate and insure for
                    several years, the <lb/>punctual payment of the army, by circulating bills, the
                        reim<lb break="no"/>bursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give
                    them <lb/>greater credit, the bill limits the sums necessary, and, more<lb
                        break="no"/>over, provides for the interest, the advantages accruing
                        there<lb break="no"/>from, and even for the payment of the principal in
                    specie in <lb/>this province, which has become expressly bound for the <lb/>same
                    at a fixed period, to any person whatever, who, from <lb/>the state of his
                    private affairs, would prefer such payment.</p>
                <p>"In full confidence that, under the present and any un<lb break="no"/>foreseen
                    circumstance, your Excellency is invested with all <lb/>necessary authority, the
                    representatives of the province and <lb/>their constituents rely on the wisdom
                    already experienced of <lb/>your administration, and in the name of the Commons
                    of <lb/>Lower Canada, I have the honour to present this bill to your
                    <lb/>Excellency, humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent."</p>
                <p>His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal <lb/>assent.</p>
                <p>His Excellency then addressed both Houses, <lb/>and the Provincial Parliament was
                    prorogued to the <lb/>16th of September.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Extract of a letter from Montreal Sept. 25</hi>
                    <lb/>"Our Friend Mr &#x2013; arrived in town from New <lb/>York a few days ago.
                    On his way he passed three <lb/>days at Plattsburgh, the head-quarters of the
                        Ame<lb break="no"/>rican army, which, from ocular observation, he states
                    <lb/>to consist of 8 or 10,000 men, under the command <lb/>of General
                    Bloomfield, Mooar, and Petit. This <lb/>force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars,
                    about the <lb/>same number of militia, and some volunteers from the
                    <lb/>southward. The militia is almost all from the state <lb/>of New York, for
                    the Yankees still refuse to march. <lb/>with this force no doubt is entertained
                    here but they</p>
                <p><pb/>will make an attack ; and if they mean to make it <lb/>this season, they
                    must be prompt in their movements, <lb/>for the weather is getting cold, and
                    they are not well <lb/>clothed or appointed. Mr &#x2013;, indeed, states
                    <lb/>half of them to be without shoes or stockings, <lb/>which will never do for
                    a winter campaign in this <lb/>country. To repel the threatened attack, we are
                    <lb/>making every preparation in our power, and the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadians
                    seem well disposed to second the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Sir George Prevost
                    has established a cordon, <lb/>the left of which is at Chambly, and extending to
                    <lb/>Chateaguny ; the main encampment is half way be<lb break="no"/>tween St
                    John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray <lb/>is at St John's with a battalion ;
                    and the Isle-au<lb break="no"/> Noix is strongly fortified, with a boom and a
                    chain <lb/>secured across the river. This line of defence is <lb/>composed of
                    four regiments of the line, and 2000 <lb/>drafted militia, with a corps of about
                    400 Canadian <lb/>voltigeurs, raised last spring. The Royals, a very <lb/>strong
                    battalion, lately arrived from the West Indies, <lb/>are now marching to join
                    the camp. The citizens, <lb/>both here and at Quebec, mount guard, and do
                    <lb/>garrison : indeed there are in this island <lb/>(Montreal) five battalions
                    of militia, say 3 to <lb/>4000 men, pretty well disciplined, and who on an
                    <lb/>alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.&#x2013; <lb/>A new regiment
                    of embodied militia has late<lb break="no"/>ly been formed by drafts from the
                    different regi<lb break="no"/>ments of inrolled militia in this island, and old
                    Major <lb/>Murray is appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen
                    of the North-west Company army are forming <lb/>a corps of their voyageurs, who
                    will be most useful <lb/>troops to act in advance with the Indians. The
                    <lb/>number originally proposed was 200, but the men <lb/>have come forward so
                    handsomely, that they are to <lb/>consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is
                        Lieutenant-Co<lb break="no"/>lonel Commandant of this corps, Mr Shaw, Major,
                    <lb/>and the other partners of the Company are Captains <lb/>and subalterns ; so
                    that the men being commanded <lb/>by those whom they have accustomed to obey,
                    may <lb/>be considered as already disciplined, at least in point <lb/>of
                    subordination.</p>
                <p>"Sir George confines his operations to mere de<lb break="no"/>fence. La Motte,
                    with about 70 Indians, advanced <lb/>through the woods, about ten days ago,
                    within hear<lb break="no"/>ing of this redoubtable army, and set up a war whoop,
                    <lb/>which so completely terrified them that though they <lb/>could see no
                    enemy, they lay on their arms for two <lb/>two successive nights, in no
                    expectation of an attack&#x2013;to <lb/>prevent which, they cut down their best
                    bridge, and <lb/>destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean <lb/>to
                    invade us. Mr &#x2013;, who was several days at <lb/>their headquarters, and who
                    was offered the rank of <lb/>Lieutenant-Colonel in the army, has, it is said,
                        pro<lb break="no"/>posed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500
                    <lb/>men ; and Sir George is said to have replied, that his <lb/>plan was fixed,
                    not to make any attack nor to send a <lb/>man across the line.</p>
                <p>"This forebearance, which the Yankees impute to <lb/>fear or weakness, tends only
                    to increase their insolent <lb/>swaggering, and their enmity is to inveterate to
                    be <lb/>allayed by any thing but hard knocks."</p>

                <p>"Head-quarters Kingston, Aug. 14. 1813 <lb/>"By accounts received from his
                    Excellency the <lb/>Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces, <lb/>from
                    Commodore Sir James Yeo, dated off York, <lb/>half-past one P.M. on the 11th
                    instant, the following <lb/>particulars have been transmitted of the capture and
                    <lb/>loss of the enemy's armed schooners:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"On Thursday evening last, the 10th instant, <lb/>the enemy's squadron, under the
                    Command of Com<lb break="no"/>modore Chauncey, got under weigh from their an<lb
                        break="no"/>chorage, off the mouth of Niagara River, and, with <lb/>a fine
                    breeze from the east, stood towards our fleet, <lb/>which were becalmed off the
                    port of Twelve Mile <lb/>Creek. At sun-set, a breeze coming off the land,
                    <lb/>gave us the wind of the enemy, when our squadron <lb/>stood for them, on
                    which immediately bore away <lb/>from us under as much sail as their schooners
                    could <lb/>carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's <lb/>fleet
                    formed a long. The Pike, Madison, Oneida, <lb/>and six schooners (two schooners
                    were placed to <lb/>windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our
                    <lb/>squadron as it should come up). At eleven the <lb/>squadron got within
                    gun-shot of the schooners, <lb/>when they opened a brisk fire, and, from their
                    <lb/>going so fast, it was more than an hour before the <lb/>Wolf, our headmost
                    ship, could pass them ; at <lb/>this time the rest of the squadron was two and
                    <lb/>three miles astern of the Wolf, and on her coming <lb/>up with the Madison
                    and Pike, they put before <lb/>the wind and made sail, firing their
                    stern-chasers.&#x2013; <lb/>Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squa<lb
                        break="no"/>dron up with the enemy, as the Wolf was the only <lb/>ship which
                    could keep up with them, then made <lb/>sail between them and the two schooners
                    to wind<lb break="no"/> ward, which he captured, and which are called <lb/>the
                    Julia and Growler, each carrying one long 32<lb break="no"/> pounder and long
                    12-pounder, and 40 men.&#x2013; <lb/>Two of the enemy's largest schooners, the
                    Scourge, <lb/>of 10, and Hamilton, of nine guns, upset on the <lb/>night of the
                    9th, in carrying sail, and all on board <lb/>perished (about 100 in number). By
                    this loss and <lb/>capture, the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 <lb/>vessels,
                    and our's increased to eight. It is ascer<lb break="no"/>tained that the Pike
                    mounts 28 long 24-pounders, <lb/>and 420 men, the Madison 22 long 32 pounders,
                    <lb/>and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on <lb/>board the enemy's
                    squadron on Monday last, for the <lb/>purpose, it is supposed, of repelling the
                    boarders.&#x2013; <lb/>The Wolf has not received any material injury, and
                    <lb/>not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on <lb/>the 11th instant, and
                    the Growler's damage repair<lb break="no"/>ed. She had lost her bowsprit, and
                    was otherwise <lb/>cut up.</p>
                <p>"Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthu<lb break="no"/>siasm of the
                    officers and men in our squadron for a <lb/>close engagement."</p>

                    <lb/>Head-quarters, Kingston, July 13.</p>
                <p>By accounts from the army under Major-General <lb/>De Rottenburg, dated the 9th
                    instant, the following <lb/>particulars have been received of a bold and
                        success<lb break="no"/>ful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort
                    <lb/>Schlosser.</p>
                <p>In the night of the 4th instant, a party, consisting <lb/>of Volunteer Thompson
                    and six privates of the 49th <lb/>regiment, under Ensign Winder, and thirty-four
                    <lb/>of the militia, the whole under the command of Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant
                    Colonel Clarke, of the Lincoln militia, cros<lb break="no"/>sed over in boats
                    from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser, <lb/>which they reached a little before
                    day-break, and <lb/>completely surprised the guard, consisting of two
                    <lb/>Lieutenants, one serjeant, and eight privates, whom <lb/>they made
                    prisoners, together with three civilians <lb/>and three of our own subjects,
                    found in the Fort.&#x2013; <lb/>The party remained in the Fort about one hour,
                    <lb/>loading their boats form the public stores and wharf, <lb/>and brought with
                    them one brass six-pounder, 57 <lb/>stand of arms, two and a half kegs of musket
                    ball <lb/>cartridges, 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for <lb/>boats, one
                    gun-boat, two batteaux, 20 barrels of <lb/>salt, 17 casks tobacco, eight barrels
                    of pork, and <lb/>one barrel of whiskey, with a number of spades, <lb/>oars, and
                    axes ; a small party of the enemy had <lb/>collected as the last boast pushed
                    off from the shore, <lb/>and several shots were fired, but the boats returned
                    <lb/>to Chippawa with their prisoners, and the articles <lb/>they had captured,
                    without a man being hurt on this <lb/>service. Further accounts have also been
                    received <lb/>from the army highly creditable to the Indian war<lb break="no"
                    />riors serving with it. On the 8th instant, a party <lb/>of the King's
                    regiment, and a body of Indian war<lb break="no"/>riors were sent to endeavour
                    to recover a consider<lb break="no"/>able quantity of medicines and surgical
                    instruments <lb/>which had been buried near the Fort George when <lb/>our troops
                    retired from it. A skirmish ensued in <lb/>consequence between the Indians and
                    the enemy, <lb/>in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men kil<lb
                        break="no"/>led and 10 taken prisoners&#x2013;the whole of the medi<lb
                        break="no"/>cines and instruments were brought off by the party <lb/>of the
                    King's; the only loss sustained being three In<lb break="no"/>dians wounded.
                    Captain Norton led the Indian <lb/>warriors with great spirit ; and much credit
                    is due <lb/>to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons, for
                    <lb/>reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were <lb/>deposited, and
                    conducting the party to it.</p>
                <p>A few nights ago, the barracks at Gravelly Point <lb/>burnt by our gun-boats, and
                    more than 100 <lb/>barrels of pork, flour, and other articles brought <lb/>away
                    from thence, together with a very fine Durham <lb/>boat&#x2013;500 oars colleced
                    and partly loaded in her <lb/>for Sacket's Harbour, being destroyed.</p>

                <p>G. O.&#x2013;His Excellency the Commander of the <lb/>forces has received a
                    dispatch from Major General De <lb/>Rottenburg, reporting a successful attack
                    upon the <lb/>enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at day<lb break="no"
                    />break on the morning of the 11th inst. by detach<lb break="no"/>ments of the
                    King's and 41st regiments, together <lb/>with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of
                    the 49th, and <lb/>about 40 militia, the whole amounting to 240 men, <lb/>under
                    the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. <lb/>The enemy's position was carried
                    by a spirited at<lb break="no"/>tack without the loss of a single man. Several
                    large <lb/>boats, loaded with stores and provisions, and three <lb/>field
                    pieces, a twelve and two six-pounders, were <lb/>brought away ; a vessel and all
                    the naval store-houses <lb/>and barracks have been burnt.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was <lb/>completed, a strong
                    reinforcement of the enemy, aid<lb break="no"/>ed by Indians, pressed this small
                    detachment, <lb/>by which Captain Saunders, of the 41st, and 15 men, <lb/>were
                    killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp, Lieutenant <lb/>Montpesson, of the 41st,
                    and 15 rank and file, wound <lb/>ed. The wounded were brought over.</p>
                <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three <lb/>wounds, severe, but not
                    considered dangerous.</p>

                <p>The following is an extract of a letter from a re<lb break="no"/>spectable
                    citizen at Burlington, dated Aug. 1. 1813</p>
                <p>"An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th <lb/>July, with intelligence that
                    the British had left the <lb/>Isle au Noix, with a force consisting of the two
                        arm<lb break="no"/>ed sloops, of 11 guns each, and four gallies, of one
                    <lb/>gun each, and 100 batteaux full of men, and had <lb/>progressed within one
                    mile of the town. The camp <lb/>was instantly alarmed, and the troops under
                    arms, <lb/>but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that <lb/>about 1000
                    troops, under the command of Colonel <lb/>Murray, had landed, and took
                    possession of Platts<lb break="no"/>burgh without opposition, there being no
                    force to op<lb break="no"/>pose them except the militia of the town and
                    vicinity, <lb/>who being only 400 in number, retreated as the ene<lb break="no"
                    />my advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State, <lb/>Pike's encampment,
                    barracks at Serenac cantonment, <lb/>and every building belonging to the United
                    States, <lb/>were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both <lb/>provisions and
                    stores. The loss cannot be less than <lb/>50,000 dollars. The enemy left
                    Plattsburgh on the <lb/>1st, and are understood to be proceeding this way
                    <lb/>[?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] <cb/>
                    <lb/>On General Dearborn invading Canada, and tak<lb break="no"/>ing possession
                    of Fort George, he sent off to Green<lb break="no"/>bush, as prisoners of war,
                    the following respectable <lb/>inhabitants : Messrs Edwards, Murehead, Dickson
                    <lb/>Lyminston, Lawe, two Kerrs, M'Ewan, Parson <lb/>Addison, Howell, Heron,
                    Green, Baldwin, Clinch <lb/>Jones, Ball, Decoe, and John Crook. Messrs
                    <lb/>Lawe, M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded <lb/>on the 27th June. General
                    Dearborn expected <lb/>that the inhabitants would have joined the Ameri<lb
                        break="no"/>cans.</p>
                <p>General Dearborn resigned the command of the <lb/>Niagara army on the 23th June,
                    on account of in<lb break="no"/>disposition. General Lewis says, in his dispatch
                    to <lb/>Secretary at War, that he did not think the Ge<lb break="no"/>neral
                    would ever again be fit for service ; that the <lb/>unfortunate events of the
                    war had deranged his un<lb break="no"/>derstanding ; and that thought sometimes
                    in a state <lb/>of convalescence, he uniformly relapsed when mili<lb break="no"
                    />tary topics were alluded to. General Lewis having <lb/>been nominated to
                    command at Sacket's Har<lb break="no"/>bour, is succeeded at Fort George,
                    Niagara, and on <lb/>the Canadian frontier, by General Boyd.</p>
                <p>The Indian chief, Tecumseh, has seized the fa<lb break="no"/>vourable moment of
                    the diversion by our shipping in <lb/>Virginia, for surround Fort Meigs with
                    2000 <lb/>warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the pos<lb break="no"
                    />sibility of receiving supplies. General Clay, who <lb/>commanded there, had
                    written urgently to General <lb/>Harrison for assistance. The latter was
                    collecting <lb/>his army to march to his relief.</p>
                <p>Sir James Yeo, after the retreat of the enemy's <lb/>army at Fort George, swept
                    the American side of <lb/>Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great
                    <lb/>Sodus, and took the whole of the provisions, con<lb break="no"/>sisting of
                    several hundred barrels of pork and flour, <lb/>and burnt the buildings. The
                    British loss was a <lb/>serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At
                    <lb/>Genessee River, he inflicted the same loss on the <lb/>enemy, taking 500
                    barrels of pork and 1700 bushels <lb/>of corn. The provisions were delivered to
                    General <lb/>Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were em<lb break="no"/>barked
                    on board the fleet, to serve as mariners</p>
                <p>There were at Quebec, on the 22d July, 1000 <lb/>American prisoners of war,
                    captured since the com<lb break="no"/>mencement of the campaign. At Beaufort
                    there were <lb/>50 officers including three General. In consequence <lb/>of the
                    conduct of the American Government and of <lb/>the officers, the latter are no
                    longer permitted to re<lb break="no"/>turn home on parole. The Melpomene
                    frigate, with <lb/>De Meuron's regiment, from the Mediterranean, <lb/>arrived in
                    the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July.</p>
                <p>James Gready, private in the 8th, or King's regi<lb break="no"/>ment, and Terence
                    Hunt, private in the 6th foot, <lb/>were in the latter end of June, tried by
                    Court Mar<lb break="no"/>tials, for deserting to the enemy, and being found in
                    <lb/>arms, and were publicy shot at Kingston, Canada, <lb/>pursuant to their
                    sentence.</p>
                <p>It appears from the Quebec papers, and from the <lb/>general orders issued by the
                    Commander in Chief in <lb/>Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkin<lb
                        break="no"/>son on the banks of the Miami river, the American <lb/>military
                    chest, containing 15,000l. Sterling was a<lb break="no"/>mong the property
                    captured by the British.</p>
                <p>Captain Waugh, of the 103d regiment, died at <lb/>Chamely on the 2d July.</p>
                <p>General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark, the <lb/>late commandant at
                    Burlington, for a defalcation of <lb/>about 50,000 dollars.</p>

                    Greenock, from Quebec, after a passage <lb/>of 36 days, papers and letters have
                    been received from <lb/>Canada, to the 19th, which contain an amount of an
                    <lb/>engagement between a detachment of the British <lb/>force under Lieut.-Col.
                    Morrison, consisting of the <lb/>49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies
                    of <lb/>the Canadian militia, and a body of American troops, <lb/>amounting to
                    4000 men, which ended in the defeat <lb/>of the latter, with great loss. This
                    action was pro<lb break="no"/>duced by the attempt of the American General to
                    <lb/>advance to Montreal, from which it appears, how<lb break="no"/>ever, he has
                    now begun to measure back his steps, <lb/>having crossed to the American side of
                    the river <lb/>where the action was fought, and being actively pur<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>sued in his retreat by the British troops.</p>
                <p>The following information has been received by <lb/>the Alexander, Captain Henry,
                    which arrived at Li<lb break="no"/>verpool on Tuesday:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"Quebec, Nov. 26. 1813 <lb/>"The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men,
                    <lb/>under the command of General Wilkinson. The <lb/>division commanded by
                    General Boyd, consisting of <lb/>about 3000 to 4000 infantry, cavalry &amp;c.
                    was alone <lb/>engaged upon the 11th instant.</p>
                <p>"The enemy lost in the action, Brigadier Gen.</p>
                <p><pb/>Conington and Colonel Preston, killed&#x2013;probably <lb/>600 men killed,
                    wounded, and taken.</p>
                <p>"The consequence was a precipitate retreat across <lb/>the St Lawrence at
                    Cornwall on the 13th, and eva<lb break="no"/>cuating the province. General
                    Wilkinson marched <lb/>his troops into the Straits, the route of Plattsburgh,
                    <lb/>leaving all his boats, upwards of 300, in the Salmon <lb/>river, where they
                    were frozen in on the 16th, and <lb/>2000 men to protect them."</p>
                <p>Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander, <lb/>with dispatches.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The following letter received in town, gives a de<lb break="no"/>scription of the
                    wanton and barbarous conduct of the <lb/>American army, in destroying a
                    settlement of the <lb/>Moravian missionaries, in their late irruption into
                    <lb/>province:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North <lb/>America, by a
                    letter from New York, dated Dec. 27 1813, <lb/>concerning a report of the total
                    destruction of our settlement, <lb/>[?] [?] on the 6th of October, by the
                    American <lb/>army under General Harrison. It was the consequence of the
                    <lb/>invasion[?] of that province, after the capture of the little fleet <lb/>on
                    Lake Erle, and the defeat of the s[?]al British force under the <lb/>[?] of
                    occupying the Chapel and some other houses for <lb/>our[?] sick British
                    soldiers, and considering the danger the Chris<lb break="no"/>tian Indians were
                    in from the malice of the Americans, it was <lb/>his advice, that the
                    Missionaries and the Indian Congregation <lb/>should retreat[?] farther into the
                    country. When the Americans <lb/>were successful in the latter, it became
                    necessary to take steps <lb/>of effect it. The British behaved very kindly to
                    the brethren, <lb/>and offered to purchase the houses and cottages, but their
                        de<lb break="no"/>feat prevented it. On entering the place, the Americans
                    first <lb/>pretended to be friendly, and sorry that the Indians had fled,
                    <lb/>who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the Mission<lb break="no"
                    />aries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall, and the aged Mis<lb break="no"
                    />sionary, Michael Young, remained.</p>
                <p>"During the first night the Americans already changed <lb/>their tone, or rather
                    showed their real character. They began <lb/>to abuse the Missionaries with
                    curses, and all manner of insults, <lb/>plundering the houses ; and General
                    Harrison, to whom we ap<lb break="no"/>pealed, would grant no redress. They took
                    every thing that <lb/>was exable[?] away ; and, under a pretence that King's
                    stores <lb/>and English goods were lodged in the houses, ransacked every
                    <lb/>place, and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals. Com<lb
                        break="no"/>modore Perry, who had defeated the Mosquito fleet on the
                    <lb/>lake, was there, and behaved rather better than the rest, ad<lb break="no"
                    />vicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could. <lb/>They did so
                    with difficulty, and shortly after the Americans <lb/>set the place on fire, and
                    burnt down the whole, even every <lb/>outhouse[?]. The poor Missionaries had a
                    very tedious journey, <lb/>and reached Silitiz, a settlement of the Brethren in
                        Pennsyl<lb break="no"/>vania, December 11. Whither the Christian Indians
                    have fled <lb/>is not known ; they had proposed to go to the Grand River,
                    <lb/>about 100 miles off.</p>

                    wilful <lb/>murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer, <lb/>as
                    outlaws.</p>
                <p>Sydney, New South Walves, Jan. 4. <lb/>The Argo has arrived with a most extensive
                    supply of tea, <lb/>viz, 167 chests of souchong, 200 ditto bobea, 200 hyson
                    skin, <lb/>and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has
                    <lb/>been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per <lb/>lb
                    currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the <lb/>Island of
                    Mauritius, the Hope American ship, laden with tea <lb/>and sundies, valued at
                    L80,000, was captured by his Maje<lb break="no"/>sty's sloop Harpy, Captain
                    Allen.</p>
                <p>In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters <lb/>of colonial and
                    British ships, and of their crews towards the <lb/>natives of New Zealand, of
                    Otaheite, and of the other islands <lb/>in the South Pacific Ocean, which have
                    led to the destruction <lb/>of several vessels, with their crews, by the
                    natives, and dis<lb break="no"/>turbed all trade and intercourse with those
                    islands, both by <lb/>British shipping and that ofthe allied powers&#x2013;his
                    Excellency <lb/>has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New
                    <lb/>South Wales, without a bond given by the master or owner to <lb/>the naval
                    officer for the time being at the port, for L.1000 <lb/>sterling, binding him
                    and his crew not to commit any act of <lb/>hostility, or to be guilty of any
                    trespass, or forment any animo<lb break="no"/>sities between the natives, or
                    take any part in any war that <lb/>may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any
                    male or female in<lb break="no"/>habitants of the islands under penalty of
                    forfeiting the sum <lb/>specified in the bond.</p>
                <p>A small party, who a short time ago undertook[?] a land pas<lb break="no"/>sage
                    in a direction towards Broken Bay, for the purpose of as<lb break="no"
                    />certaining the nature and fertility of the country, have disco<lb break="no"
                    />vered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence <lb/>of which
                    one gentlemen, Mr Robert Campbell, has already <lb/>sent thither an extensive
                    herd of cattle, and this example is <lb/>likely to be followed by others.</p>
                <p>Thomas West, who came to this colony a convict for life, <lb/>in the ship Earl
                    Cornwall's[?], in 1801, has received from his <lb/>Excellency a conditional
                    pardon, in consideration of his general <lb/>good conduct and character for
                    sobriety and industry, and also <lb/>in consideration of his having lately
                    erected a water mill for <lb/>the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen, within two
                    miles of <lb/>Sydney, being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty
                    <lb/>of this town.</p>
                <p>Sydney, New South Wales, May 21. <lb/>The good understanding between the natives
                    and our <lb/>settlers, which had been maintained for the last six years,
                    <lb/>has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal con<lb break="no"
                    />sequences. On Saturday, a body of 60 natives commenced <lb/>plundering the
                    fields of a settler, when three privates of the <lb/>veteran battalion fired
                    upon them and killed a boy. The na<lb break="no"/>rushed upon them before they
                    could load again, and <lb/>killed on private, Isaac Eustace, and compelled the
                    other <lb/>two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs <lb/>Milehouse
                    and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers <lb/>falling in with them, shot a
                    woman and two children&#x2013;the <lb/>savages attacked William Baker, a
                    stock-keeper of Mr Mac<lb break="no"/>Arthur, killed the man and two women,
                    named Sullivan and <lb/>Herburg.</p>
                <p>Sydney, New South Wales, Feb. 12. <lb/>On Monday last arrived the ship General
                    Hewett, Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Earle, from England, having a detachment of the
                    46th <lb/>regiment, commanded by Major Oglivie ; and yesterday ar<lb break="no"
                    />rived the Windham, Captain Bligh, also from England, <lb/>having on board the
                    head-quarters of the 46th regiment, <lb/>commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Molle,
                    who succeeded <lb/>Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connell, as Lieutenant-Governor of
                    <lb/>the territory, and is accompanied by Mrs Molle and family ; <lb/>also
                    Lieutenant Walters, of the navy, agent for transports&#x2013; <lb/>Of the 300
                    convicts which the General Hewett received on <lb/>board, 35 died on the
                    passage.</p>

                <p>[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.] <lb/>Quebec, July 15. <lb/>The
                    commercial world is flourishing here, but in <lb/>political matters, I am sorry
                    to say, we are sadly in <lb/>the back ground. The old defensive system is still
                    <lb/>adhered to, and, I fear much, with all our reinforce<lb break="no"/>ments,
                    we shall do little good till we have another <lb/>commander in chief. There is
                    now a great body of <lb/>regular troops in this country, and a handful of brave
                    <lb/>fellows have recently been almost sacrificed <hi rend="italic">par la</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">petite guerre</hi> at Chippawa, whilst, in the lower
                        pro<lb break="no"/>vince, there are at least 10,000 regulars doing no<lb
                        break="no"/>thing.</p>
                <p>Some of the officers of the regiments lately arriv<lb break="no"/>ed from France
                    do not conceal their sentiments&#x2013; <lb/>On inspecting one of the regiments
                    the other day, <lb/>our chief took occasion, as usual, to make some re<lb
                        break="no"/>marks on the cut of the men's clothes, when the Co<lb break="no"
                    />lonel commanding stepped forward and told him <lb/>plainly, that such systems
                    were now completely ex<lb break="no"/>ploded&#x2013;that he had had the honour
                    of ser<lb break="no"/>ving very lately under a much more celebrated</p>
                <p><pb/>General that it was probable he would ever serve <lb/>under
                    again&#x2013;that his men had been accustomed to <lb/>fight, not to dance ; and
                    if such was the plan he was <lb/>called on to follow, he should certainly retire
                    from <lb/>the service. Such language you may suppose was <lb/>not very pleasing
                    to our Governor ; but I am happy <lb/>to find that we now have military men
                    amongst us, <lb/>who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the
                    <lb/>numberless representations of civilians are not much <lb/>attended to.</p>
                <p>Montreal, July 14. <lb/>I consider this country now as perfectly secure
                    <lb/>against any attempts that the Americans may make, <lb/>not withstanding the
                    system of our chief does not <lb/>seem to be changed. He has received a great
                    many <lb/>more troops this year than he had any idea of, and <lb/>does not seem
                    pleased at having so large a force un<lb break="no"/>his command, as the country
                    will now look to <lb/>him for some offensive operation against the enemy.
                    <lb/>He has done nothing the whole summer but pa<lb break="no"/>rade about 6000
                    men at Chambly, where he makes <lb/>them march past him twice a-week, bowing and
                    <lb/>scraping, instead of emplying them where they <lb/>ought to be.</p>
                <p>You will have heard of an American army of <lb/>about 6000, under General Jacob
                    Brown, having <lb/>crossed the river at Fort Erie, when General Rial, <lb/>with
                    a force of 1500 only, gallantly assailed them <lb/>but was overpowered by
                    numbers, and sustained con<lb break="no"/>siderable loss. I inclose a general
                    order published <lb/>yesterday about this unfortunate business, whereby <lb/>you
                    will find that our loss has been great.</p>
                <p>Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly <lb/>any force, and it appears very
                    singular indeed, that <lb/>so great a body of men, as are now on the other side
                    <lb/>of the river, from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix, at <lb/>least 10,000 men, should
                    be left for the purpose of <lb/>parade, when they are so much wanted in the
                    upper <lb/>province.</p>
                <p>I sincerely hope that some investigation will take <lb/>place into this business,
                    as it is really disgraceful to <lb/>think that such an enemy should be able to
                    make an <lb/>attack upon us with impunity.</p>

                <p>The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken <lb/>by the British. This

                <p>Major General Conran, of the Royal, has had the misfor<lb break="no"/>tune to

                <p>The 3rd[?], 104th flank[?] companies, 103d, 8th, or King's, <lb/>100th, regiment
                    de Watteville, [?] battalion of 1st, or <lb/>Royal Scots, and 41st flank[?]
                    companies are with the army <lb/>under Lieutenant General Drummon, on the
                    Niagara fron<lb break="no"/>tier, Upper Canada.</p>
                <p>The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal.</p>
                <p>On the 15th of August, the British troops under Lieute<lb break="no"/>nant
                    General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack <lb/>was made in three columns,
                    under Colonel Scott of the 103d <lb/>regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th
                    regiment, and <lb/>Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two
                    <lb/>former were directed to scale the fort, and the latter to get
                    <lb/>possession of a small hill, named Snake-Hill, which the Ame<lb break="no"
                    />ricans had fortified, and being situated only about eight hun<lb break="no"
                    />dred yards from Fort Erie, was of consequence to us. This <lb/>latter column
                    failed in their object ; but the two columns des<lb break="no"/>tined for the
                    fort carried the same in a most gallant manner, <lb/>and obliged the enemy to
                    retire into two stone block-houses <lb/>inside the fort, when their own guns
                    were turned against <lb/>them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took
                    place, <lb/>which blew up the magazine and battery, and with them a <lb/>number
                    of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused <lb/>by this was so great,
                    and we were obliged to abandon our <lb/>conquest, and retreat to our original
                    position, with great loss <lb/>of both officers and men.</p>
                <p>The large ship-building by the British at Kingston, on Lake <lb/>Ontario is to be
                    launched the second week in September&#x2013; <lb/>also will carry about 100
                    guns.</p>
                <p>The battalion of royal marines, commanded by Lieutenant<lb break="no"/> Colonel
                    Williams, and which has been stationed lately at Isle <lb/>au Noix, and parts
                    adjacent, have been broken up and distri<lb break="no"/>buted among the fleets
                    on the Lakes. The Staff of the batta<lb break="no"/>lion proceed immediately to
                    Halifax from Quebec, in the Cey<lb break="no"/>long armed-en [?] ship.</p>
                <p>The Junon frigate, Captain Upton, has arrived from Hali<lb break="no"/>fax at
                    Quebec, with money for Government. The crew of <lb/>this vessel is to be
                    employed on the Lakes.</p>
                <p>A brig, which sailed from Cork, under convoy of the An<lb break="no"/>telope, of
                    50 guns, has arrived at Quebec.&#x2013;The Antelope, <lb/>and the ships under
                    convoy, are hourly expected. It is <lb/>said that there are on board the ships
                    of the latter about <lb/>4000 troops, chiefly detachments and reinforcements for
                    the <lb/>regimentsin Canada.</p>
                <p>Captain Dowale, of the royal navy, now commands the <lb/>fleet on Lake
                    Champlain.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Quebec, Sept. 3. <lb/>The army from this province has entered the United States
                    <lb/>by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was <lb/>at
                    Chazy.</p>
                <p>Quebec, Sept. 8. <lb/>From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada, Messrs
                    <lb/>M'Gillivray and M'Leod, who arrived here on Thursday last, <lb/>have
                    brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal, <lb/>at Michillimackinac,
                    written since the repulse of the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can forces sent there to
                    recapture it. The following are <lb/>the particulars of that expedition
                    :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"On the forenoon of the 5th of August, the Americans <lb/>landed 900 men, or
                    thereabouts, at the back of the island <lb/>(Dowsman's farm). There is a
                    considerable space of ground <lb/>cleared, and a gentle slope, which enabled
                    their vessels, at <lb/>anchor close to the beach, to keep clear, by a constant
                    fire of <lb/>grape, &amp;c. and which by the situation of the ground, passed
                    <lb/>directly over the men's heads, as they formed and advanced <lb/>towards the
                    woods.</p>
                <p>"Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison <lb/>(150 at most) at
                    the extremity of the woods, and the Indians <lb/>were stationed on each flank,
                    to keep the enemy from out<lb break="no"/>flanking the troops. By a false
                    account of the enemy's inten<lb break="no"/>tion to land on another part of the
                    island, a certain number of <lb/>Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but
                    more Indians <lb/>absenting themselves, exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colon<lb
                        break="no"/>nel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was enter<lb
                        break="no"/>tained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison
                    <lb/>from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back
                    <lb/>between the two forts, and there await the advance of the <lb/>enemy.</p>
                <p>"A party of between 40 and 50 Indians, placed on the left <lb/>flank, and
                    ignorant of the movements in the centre and right <lb/>flank, fired on the
                    Americans, and threw them into confusion, <lb/>which the Indians soon perceived,
                    and encouraging each other <lb/>by whoops and yells, totally broke the little
                    order still observed <lb/>by the enemy, who took instant flight, and were all
                    out of <lb/>reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of <lb/>their
                    retreat.</p>
                <p>"Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred <lb/>men defeated and put
                    to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians, <lb/>with a loss of 17 men and a Major
                    (Holmes) killed and found <lb/>on the spot!&#x2013;The Indians lost but one
                    man."</p>
                <p>Previous to and combined with this, the measures taken by <lb/>the enemy were
                    these:</p>
                <p>"On the [?] of July, a detachment of the expedition sent <lb/>against
                    Michillimackinac by the enemy, proceeded to St Ma<lb break="no"/>ry's, where
                    they met with no resistance, there being neither <lb/>troops nor Indians, and
                    every person occupied about their <lb/>usual concerns ; such as bay making,
                    fishing &amp;c. Major <lb/>Holmes commanded the party, who gave up to
                    indiscriminate <lb/>plunder, and destroyed the whole of the property belonging
                    <lb/>to the North West Company ; burning their houses, stores, <lb/>and vessels,
                    killing their cattle, and taking off their engagees <lb/>prisoners ; tearing
                    down the fences, destroying the gardens, <lb/>fields, &amp;c. Many wanton acts
                    of cruelty might be detailed. <lb/>Let two suffice for the present.</p>
                <p>"Mr Johnstone's property was plundered, even his furni<lb break="no"/>ture ; the
                    very clothing of his wife and children was seized <lb/>upon by these ruthless
                    plunderers, and carried away. Major <lb/>Holmes sent to the south side of the
                    strait for Mr Johnstone's <lb/>son George, and, after threatening and reviling
                    him with the <lb/>most oppobrious language, flourished his sword over his head,
                    <lb/>and said he had a great mind to cut his head off, now he was <lb/>his
                    slave, When they were in the act of burning the houses <lb/>and stores, Mr G.
                    Johnstone was ordered to stand in a cer<lb break="no"/>tain spot, under pain of
                    being shot ; but had he remained, suf<lb break="no"/>foration[?] must have been
                    his fate, being so near the buildings <lb/>in flames : he therefore risked being
                    shot, and came off, and <lb/>thereby effected a timely escape.</p>
                <p>"Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exer<lb break="no"/>cised on a
                    poor horse, which they made us of all day in cart<lb break="no"/>ing their
                    plunder, and in the evening, whilst still tackled to <lb/>the cart, tied him to
                    the end of the dwelling-house then in <lb/>flames, and amused themselves in
                    looking at the poor animal <lb/>making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he
                    was burnt, and <lb/>his bones seen there by the writer of this."</p>

                <p>Montreal, Oct. 29 <lb/>The express from Upper Canada, which arrived
                    <lb/>yesterday morning, confirmed the highly satisfactory <lb/>reports of the
                    preceding day, that the enemy had <lb/>precipitately retreated on the 19th
                    instant, from be<lb break="no"/>fore Chippawa, after destroying a quantity of
                        provi<lb break="no"/>sions and heavy baggage ; and that, on the 21st, they
                    <lb/>had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their <lb/>force, and were
                    blowing up the works at Fort Erie.</p>
                <p>Further accounts from Kingston have been receiv<lb break="no"/>ed this morning to
                    the 26th instant, when the official <lb/>report of the enemy's retreat from Fort
                    Erie, after the <lb/>destruction of the works, had not reached that place,
                    <lb/>but there was no doubt of the fact.</p>
                <p>Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps <lb/>pressing on the enemy ; the
                    master of a mail which <lb/>arrived at Kingston on the 25th, in twenty-four
                    hours <lb/>from Fort George, further confirms the previous <lb/>intelligence,
                    and reports that several hundred prisoners <lb/>were taken, before the Americans
                    effected their <lb/>escape across the river.</p>
                <p>On the 18th the British came up with his rear <lb/>guard, and in a sharp action
                    thirty of the Americans <lb/>were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening
                    <lb/>on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.&#x2013; <lb/>The enemy then fled
                    with the utmost precipitation <lb/>to Fort Erie, and began the destruction of
                    his for<lb break="no"/>tifications.</p>
                <p>A military courier from Kingston arrived this <lb/>morning, brings no additional
                    news of importance.&#x2013; <lb/>Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the
                    <lb/>sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again <lb/>sailed for the head of
                    the Lake.</p>
                <p>A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant, <lb/>says that a severe action
                    took place the day before <lb/>near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed
                    and <lb/>wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be <lb/>very considerable ; a
                    field piece made to bear upon <lb/>one of his columns did great execution.
                    Another <lb/>letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wound<lb break="no"
                    />ed 25 or 30.</p>
                <p>Montreal, Nov. 5. <lb/>From Upper Canada we have received nothing of
                    <lb/>importance. The report of the whole American <lb/>armies have crossed the
                    Niagara was a mistake as <lb/>the last accounts from that quarter mention that
                        Ge<lb break="no"/>neral Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie.</p>
                <p>Quebec, Nov. 3. <lb/>We are in expectation of some further details of <lb/>the
                    operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's <lb/>Montreal post ; but they
                    had no arrived at one <lb/>o'clock.</p>
                <p>The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on <lb/>that frontier is a striking
                    illustration of the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of the command of the lake. The
                    enemy did <lb/>cross over to our side till the moment his fleet <lb/>was ready
                    to assume the superiority. The re-appear<lb break="no"/>ance of our fleet
                    effected what could not be done by <lb/>the expence of so much blood and
                    treasure.</p>
                <p>(From the Quebec Gazette) <lb/>The American Government has published the pa<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We <lb/>confess that we
                    have seen these papers with feelings <lb/>of some satisfaction and much regret ;
                    satisfaction <lb/>that we can now say that the honour of the British
                    <lb/>Government is pledged to do something for Bri<lb break="no"/>tish interests
                    in North American, and regret that that <lb/>something is so little.</p>
                <p>The Indians are to be made independent of both <lb/>nations. This is perfectly
                    just, and would, under <lb/>certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of
                    <lb/>these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively <lb/>British. On these
                    subjects we must be permitted to <lb/>ask how long they would be permitted to
                    remain <lb/>so, how long the Indians would retain their inde<lb break="no"
                    />pendence in the event of another war, if the commu<lb break="no"/>nication
                    with them should be in the power of the <lb/>enemy ? The sole communication for
                    military pur<lb break="no"/>poses, with the Indians and the Lakes, is by the
                    river <lb/>St Lawrence, from Montreal to Kingston, and from <lb/>Niagara to Fort
                    Erie ; and the Americans are to be <lb/>permitted to remain in possession of one
                    of its banks ! <lb/>The enemy has hitherto been prevented from inter<lb
                        break="no"/>rupting this communication by the thinness of the
                    <lb/>settlements of their side, the consequent badness of <lb/>the roads, and
                    difficulty of supplying a large force. <lb/>The possession of th southern bank
                    of the St Law<lb break="no"/>rence between Montreal and Kingson, and the power
                    <lb/>of supplying themselves, and operating on that fron<lb break="no"/>tier, by
                    the roads now existing, and from Lake <lb/>Champlain, has been worth a large
                    force to them, <lb/>during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to
                    <lb/>parcel our force to support the line of communication <lb/>between Lake St
                    Francis and Kingston, and keep a <lb/>great proportion of it to protect the base
                    of that line <lb/>in the vicinity of Montreal.</p>
                <p>The position of Canada, relative to the United <lb/>States, with its present
                    boundaries, is an extraordi<lb break="no"/>nary one ; so much so, that
                    intelligent military men <lb/>have pronounced it incapable of defence much
                    beyond <lb/>Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's prepa<lb break="no"
                    />rations, the superiority which we then had on the <lb/>Lakes, the good
                    disposition of the inhabitants, and <lb/>the prudent conduct of the commander of
                    the forces, <lb/>alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting <lb/>and
                    conveying supplies by a communication of five</p>
                <p><pb/>hundred miles, adjoining the whole way to the ene<lb break="no"/>my's
                    frontie, is conceivable only to those whom ex<lb break="no"/>perience has made
                    acquainted with the fact, or who <lb/>are habituated to reflection ; and
                    whenever the com<lb break="no"/>munication of the Lakes becomes interrupted, the
                    <lb/>supply of any force further advanced on the line be<lb break="no"/>comes
                    utterly impracticable. The enemy derives <lb/>his supplies either by the Lakes,
                    upon which an army <lb/>can effect nothing, or from a settled country, a long
                    <lb/>way in his rear, protected by his army, a country co<lb break="no"/>vered
                    with woods, and a militia more effective than <lb/>the best troops in such a
                    country, always ready for <lb/>the protection of their property and their
                    houses&#x2013; <lb/>Under such circumstances, the weakness of an army
                    <lb/>beyond a certain point is to be counted by its num<lb break="no"/>bers.</p>
                <p>We scruple not to say, that, whenever that part <lb/>of the State of New York
                    extending to the St Law<lb break="no"/>rence, between Lake Ontario and Lake
                    Champlain, <lb/>shall be fully settled, the whole of Upper Canada <lb/>must fall
                    to the United States, the Lower Canada <lb/>will not be defensible but at an
                    expence of means <lb/>far beyond its value. We had much rather see the
                    <lb/>Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's <lb/>Harbour,
                    Presqu-ile, Detroit and Michilimackinac, <lb/>than in the possession of the
                    tract of country just <lb/>mentioned. Great Britain will always have the
                    <lb/>means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes, <lb/>whenever she chuses
                    to exert them, but she never <lb/>will be able to drive the Americans out of
                    that fron<lb break="no"/>tier, when once fully settled, supported as they will
                    <lb/>be by the immense population of the back parts of <lb/>the State of New
                    York and adjoining States.</p>

                    <lb/>after a session of four weeks. The principal laws <lb/>passed are:</p>
                <p>An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of <lb/>this State.
                    <lb/>An act to encourage privateering. <lb/>An act to authorise the raising of a

                <p>The first act authorises the Governor to call into <lb/>actual service 12,000

                <p>The following resolution, introduced by Mr Mo<lb break="no"/>nell, passed both
                    Houses of our Legislature unani<lb break="no"/>mously on Saturday:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>Resolved unanimously&#x2013;That the House of Assembly of <lb/>the State of New

                    the extravagant and disgraceful terms <lb/>proposed by the British Commissioners
                    at Ghent&#x2013;that, how<lb break="no"/>ever ardently they may desire the
                    restoration of peace to their <lb/>country, they can never consent to receive it
                    at the sacrifice <lb/>of national honour and dignity&#x2013;that they therefore
                    strongly <lb/>recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the
                    <lb/>vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of <lb/>the war, as
                    the best means of the bringing the contest to an ho<lb break="no"/>nourable
                    termination, and of transmitting unimpaired to their <lb/>posterity their
                    rights, liberty, and independence.</p>
                <p>The following is a private letter which was brought <lb/>by the Liffey :</p>
                <p>Montreal, Nov. 5. 1814. <lb/>"Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the
                    <lb/>10th October, where his presence has been of the ut<lb break="no"/>most
                    importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade <lb/>of that place on the 8th, and
                    retired with his squad<lb break="no"/>ron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which
                    was <lb/>ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's <lb/>arrival,
                    sailed for Niagara on the 16th, with 500 of <lb/>the 90th, and a supply of
                    provisions and stores for <lb/>the right division, and arrived off Fort George
                    on the <lb/>evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ment, Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th.</p>
                <p>"The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by <lb/>General Izard's army, making a
                    force of 7 or 8000 <lb/>men, advanced upon General Drummond, and at<lb
                        break="no"/>tacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th <lb/>instant
                    ; but having met with an opposition unexpect<lb break="no"/>ed by them, and
                    making no impression, retired on <lb/>the 16th and 17th to Black Creek, from
                    whence they <lb/>advanced one of Izard's brigades, 1500 men, on the <lb/>19th,
                    with a view of our turning our right, and attempt<lb break="no"/>ed to cross the
                    Chippawa, about six miles from its <lb/>mouth, where they were met with by a
                    corps of about <lb/>1000 troops, under Colonel Meyers, who faced them <lb/>most
                    manfully ; they skirmished the whole day, in <lb/>which the Glengarries
                    supported their high charac<lb break="no"/>ter, and, in the evening, <hi
                        rend="italic">Jonathan</hi> finding himself <lb/>foiled, and unable to bring
                    up his artillery from the <lb/>horrid state of the roads, retired again to the
                    main <lb/>body at Black Creek.</p>
                <p>"Our casualties on this occasion were triflin&#x2013; <lb/>those of the enemy
                    were said to have been considerable, <lb/>though he refrained from exposing
                    himself to our <lb/>fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces <lb/>there,
                    and whenever the enemy showed a column <lb/>out of the wood, a well-directed
                    discharge soon o<lb break="no"/>bliged them to return to their shelter. By this
                    time <lb/>our fleet being announced, gave alarm to the enemy, <lb/>and they
                    commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort <lb/>Erie.</p>
                <p>"They were purused on the 20th and 21st by <lb/>our advance, under Major-General
                    Watteville, close <lb/>to Fort Erie, where he found them occupying the <lb/>high
                    ground, which General Drummond had not <lb/>left many weeks before, and could
                    push no further. <lb/>At the date of the last accounts from General Drum<lb
                        break="no"/>mond, Jonathan still maintained his post, from which <lb/>it
                    will require a few columns of fresh troops to dis<lb break="no"/>lodge him, but
                    as they are now on their way to join <lb/>the right dividion, I trust I shall in
                    a short time have <lb/>the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expul<lb
                        break="no"/>sion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is <lb/>said,
                    that for want of sufficient shelter, a part of Ge<lb break="no"/>neral Izard's
                    force had crossed to Buffalo, and that <lb/>they had passed over some heavy
                    artillery and stores, <lb/>leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived
                        ca<lb break="no"/>pable of defending it.</p>
                <p>"Sir James brough down with him the skeleton <lb/>of the 1st battalion of the
                    King's regiment, and the</p>
                <p><pb/>remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He <lb/>sailed again on the
                    1st inst. taking with him about 1200 <lb/>men, comprising the 37th, a brigade of
                    artillery, a 9<lb break="no"/>pounder, and detachments from the 6th and 82d
                        re<lb break="no"/>giments, and a large supply of provisions and stores.
                    <lb/>The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to <lb/>York would be
                    crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th, <lb/>850 strong, were to have been
                    embarked in the fleet, <lb/>but Sir James could not take them. The Royals, 41st,
                    <lb/>89th, and 100th, exhausted corps, return to Kingston by <lb/>this trip of
                    the fleet, which I fear was scarcely able to <lb/>make another this season. The
                    St Lawrence has proved <lb/>a noble ship, and one and all seem delighted with
                    her. <lb/>The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston, where she <lb/>has been laid
                    down and lengthened to make her the <lb/>size of the Prince Regent. The keel of
                    a 74 is also laid <lb/>down there. The Americans are said to have com<lb
                        break="no"/>menced upon two more ships of the class of the Su<lb break="no"
                    />perior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th <lb/>October state, that the
                    capture of the two schooners <lb/>will be attended with the most important
                    benefits in <lb/>the security of that post, and the territory dependent
                    <lb/>upon it. Captain Rocheblave, with the detachment <lb/>of the 81st under
                    Capt. Wardrop, and artillery, ar<lb break="no"/>rived there on the 14th October,
                    without any cas<lb break="no"/>ualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie, with
                    his <lb/>brigade, would arrive about the 21st. The two <lb/>schooners had made a
                    trip to Nottawasage for provi<lb break="no"/>sions and supplies, and would
                    attempt another before <lb/>the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been
                    <lb/>sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain.</p>
                <p>"The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and <lb/>supplying General Drummond's
                    army being com<lb break="no"/>pleted, and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour
                    being <lb/>deemed impracticable this season, Sir George return<lb break="no"/>ed
                    last evening to this place ; his journey to King<lb break="no"/>ston has
                    certainly had the effect of inducing Ge<lb break="no"/>neral Brown, with a
                    considerable part of his force, <lb/>to move to Sackett's Harbour, and has thus
                    left <lb/>General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie, that <lb/>I have little
                    doubt of the result of an attack upon <lb/>him.</p>
                <p>"I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party <lb/>here has been at work
                    at your side of the water ; it <lb/>has increased tenfold since the expression
                    of the <lb/>public sentiment in favour of his Excellency, by the <lb/>addresses
                    which are now preparing, and which I <lb/>can assure you is the real and
                    unsolicited voice <lb/>of the people. I am happy to find that General <lb/>Kempt
                    is going to England, as he will afford true <lb/>information upon the state of
                    the country, and be <lb/>able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circu<lb
                        break="no"/>lated respecting recent events."</p>

                </p>
                <p>A journey into the interior of New South Wales, across the <lb/>Blue Mountains,
                    performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac <lb/>quarrie, Governor of the
                    settlement. From the official ac<lb break="no"/>count, dated Sydney, June 10.
                    1815.</p>
                <p>The Governor desires to communicate, for the <lb/>information of the public, the
                    result of his late <lb/>tour over the Western or Blue Mountains, un<lb
                        break="no"/>dertaken for the purpose of being enabled per<lb break="no"
                    />sonally to appreciate the importance of the track <lb/>of country lying
                    westward of them, which had <lb/>been explored in the latter end of the year
                    1813, <lb/>and beginning of 1814, by Mr George William <lb/>Evans, Deputy
                    Surveyor of Lands.</p>
                <p>To those who know how very limited a track <lb/>of country has been hitherto
                    occupied by the <lb/>colonists of New South Walves, extending along <lb/>the
                    eastern coast to the north and south of Port <lb/>Jackson only 80 miles, and
                    westward about 40 <lb/>miles, to the foot of that chain of mountains in <lb/>the
                    interior which forms its western boundary, <lb/>it must be a subject of
                    astonishment and regret, <lb/>that amongst so large a population no one ap<lb
                        break="no"/>peared, within the first twenty-five years of the
                    <lb/>establishment of this settlement, possessed of suf<lb break="no"/>ficient
                    energy of mind to induce him fully to ex<lb break="no"/>plore a passage over
                    these mountains ; but when <lb/>it is considered that for the greater part of
                    that <lb/>time even this circumscribed portion of country <lb/>afforded
                    sufficient produce for the wants of the <lb/>people, whilst on the other hand,
                    the whole sur<lb break="no"/>face of the country beyond those limits was a
                    <lb/>thick, and in many places, nearly an impene<lb break="no"/>trable forest,
                    the surprise at the want of effort to <lb/>surmount such difficulties must abate
                    very con<lb break="no"/>siderably.</p>
                <p>The records of the colony only afford two in<lb break="no"/>stances of any bold
                    attempt having been made to <lb/>discover the country to the westward of the
                    Blue <lb/>Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass, and the <lb/>other by Mr Caley,
                    and both ended in disap<lb break="no"/>pointment; a cirumstance which will not
                    be <lb/>much wondered at by those who have lately cross<lb break="no"/>ed these
                    mountains.</p>
                <p>To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, <lb/>Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson, of
                    the Royal <lb/>veteran company, the merit is due of having, <lb/>with
                    extraordinary patience and much fatigu, ef<lb break="no"/>fected the first
                    passage over the most rugged and <lb/>difficult part of the Blue Mountains.</p>
                <p>The Governor being strongly impressed with <lb/>the importance of the object,
                    had, early after his <lb/>arrival in this colony, formed the resolution of
                    <lb/>encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the <lb/>western country, and
                    willingly availed himself of <lb/>the facilities which the discoveries of these
                    three <lb/>gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly, on the <lb/>20th of November
                    1813, he entrusted the ac<lb break="no"/>complishment of this object to Mr
                    George Wil<lb break="no"/>liam Evans, deputy surveyor of lands, the result
                    <lb/>of whose journey was laid before the public, <lb/>through the medium of the
                    Sydney Gazette, on <lb/>the 12th of February, 1814.</p>
                <p>The favourable account given by Mr Evans <lb/>of the country he had explored,
                    induced the <lb/>Governor to cause a road to be constructed for <lb/>the passage
                    and conveyance of cattle and pro<lb break="no"/>visions to the interior ; and
                    men of good cha<lb break="no"/>racter, from amongst a number of convicts who
                    <lb/>had volunteered their services, were selected to <lb/>perform this arduous
                    work, on condition of be<lb break="no"/>ing fed and clothed during the
                    continuance of <lb/>their labour, and being granted emancipations <lb/>as their
                    final reward on the completion of the <lb/>work.</p>
                <p>The direction and superintendence of this great <lb/>work was entrusted to
                    William Cox. Esq. the <lb/>chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the asto<lb
                        break="no"/>nishment of every one who knows what was to be <lb/>encountered,
                    and sees what has been done, he <lb/>effected its completion in six months from
                    the <lb/>time of its commencement, happily without the <lb/>loss of a man, or
                    any serious accident. The <lb/>Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the
                    <lb/>services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony, in <lb/>the execution of this
                    arduous work, which pro<lb break="no"/>mises to be of the greatest public
                    utility, by <lb/>opening a new source of wealth to the indus<lb break="no"
                    />trious and enterprising. When it is considered <lb/>that Mr Cox voluntarily
                    relinquished the com<lb break="no"/>forts of his own house, and the society of
                    his <lb/>numerous family, and exposed himself to much <lb/>personal fatigue,
                    with only such temporary co<lb break="no"/>vering as the bark hut could afford
                    from the in<lb break="no"/>clemency of the season, it is difficult to express
                    <lb/>the sentiments of approbation to which such pri<lb break="no"/>vations and
                    services are entitled.</p>
                <p>Mr Cox having reported the road as complet<lb break="no"/>ed on the 21st of
                    January, the Governor, ac<lb break="no"/>companied by Mrs Macquarrie, and that
                        gentle<lb break="no"/>man, commenced his tour on the 25th of April
                    <lb/>last, over the Blue Mountains, and was joined <lb/>by Sir John Jamieson, at
                    the Nepean, who ac<lb break="no"/>companied him during the entire tour. The
                        fol<lb break="no"/>lowing gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: <lb/>Mr
                    Campbell, Secretary ; Captain Antill, Ma<lb break="no"/>jor of Brigade ;
                    Lieutenant Watts, Aide de<lb break="no"/> camp ; Mr Redfern, Assistant-Surgeon ;
                    Mr <lb/>Oxley, Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan, Deputy <lb/>Surveyor-General ; Mr
                    Lewin, Painter and Na<lb break="no"/>turalist ; and Mr G. Evans, Deputy Surveyor
                    of <lb/>lands, who had been sent forward for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of
                    making further discoveries, and rejoined <lb/>the party on the day of arrival at
                    Bathurst <lb/>Plains.</p>
                <p>The commencement of the ascent from Emu <lb/>Plains to the first depot, and
                    thence to a resting <lb/>place, now called Spring Wood, distant twelve
                    <lb/>miles from Emu Ford, was through a very hand<lb break="no"/>some open
                    forests of lofty trees, and much more <lb/>practicable and easy than was
                    expected. The <lb/>facility of the ascent for this distance excited
                    <lb/>surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to <lb/>give the traveller a
                    just idea of the difficulties he <lb/>has afterwards to encounter. At a further
                        dis<lb break="no"/>stance of four miles a sudden change is perceiv<lb
                        break="no"/>ed in the appearance of the timber and the qua<lb break="no"
                    />lity of the soil, the former becoming stunted, and <lb/>the latter barren and
                    rocky. At this place, the <lb/>fatigues of the journey may be said to commence.
                    <lb/>Here the country became altogether mountain<lb break="no"/>ous, and
                    extremely rugged. Near to the 18th <lb/>mile (it is to be observed that the
                    measure com<lb break="no"/>mences at Emu Ford), a pile of stones attracted
                    <lb/>attention. It is close to the line of road, on the <lb/>top of a rugged and
                    abrupt ascent, and is sup<lb break="no"/>posed to have been placed there by Mr
                    Caley, as <lb/>the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Go<lb break="no"/>vernor
                    gave that part of the mountain the name <lb/>as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have
                    penetrated even so <lb/>far was at that time an effort of no small difficul<lb
                        break="no"/>ty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a <lb/>succession of
                    steep and rugged hills, some of <lb/>which are almost so abrupt as to deny a
                    passage <lb/>altogether ; but at this place a considerable ex<lb break="no"
                    />tensive plain is arrived at, which constitutes the <lb/>summit of the western
                    mountains ; and from <lb/>thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect
                    <lb/>presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town <lb/>of Windsor, the
                    river Hawkesbury, Prospect <cb/>
                    <lb/>Hill, and other objects within that part of the <lb/>colony now inhabited,
                    of equal interest, are dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly seen from hence. The majestic
                        gran<lb break="no"/>deur of the situation, combined with the various
                    <lb/>objects to be seen from this place, induced the <lb/>Governor to give it
                    the appellation of the King's <lb/>Table Land. On the south-west side of the
                    <lb/>King's Table Land the mountain terminates in <lb/>abrupt precipices of
                    immense depth, at the bot<lb break="no"/>tom of which is seen a glen, as
                    romantically <lb/>beautiful as can be imagined, bounded on the <lb/>further side
                    by mountains of great magnitude, <lb/>terminating equally abruptly as the
                    others, and <lb/>the whole thickly covered with wood. The <lb/>length of this
                    picturesque and remarkable track of <lb/>country is about 24 miles, to which the
                        Go<lb break="no"/>vernor gave the name of the Prince Regent's <lb/>Glen.
                    Proceeding hence to the thirty-third <lb/>mile, on the top of a hill, an opening
                    presents <lb/>itself on the south-west side of the Prince <lb/>Regent's Glen,
                    from whence a view is obtained <lb/>particularly beautiful and
                    grand&#x2013;mountains ris<lb break="no"/>ing beyond mountains, with stupendous
                    masses <lb/>of rock in the fore ground, here strike the eye <lb/>with admiration
                    and astonishment. The circular <lb/>form in which the whole is so wonderfully
                        dis<lb break="no"/>posed induced the Governor to give the name of
                    <lb/>Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right <lb/>Hon. William Pitt) to this
                    offset of branch from the <lb/>Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from
                    <lb/>hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of <lb/>the mountain which
                    forms one side of the Prince <lb/>Regent's Glen, and there it suddenly
                    terminates <lb/>in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet <lb/>high, as
                    ascertained by measurement. The road <lb/>constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged
                    and <lb/>tremendous descent, through all its windings, is <lb/>no less than
                    three-fourths of a mile in length, <lb/>and has been executed with such skill
                    and sta<lb break="no"/>bility as reflects much credit on him. The la<lb
                        break="no"/>bour here undergone, and the difficulties sur<lb break="no"
                    />mounted, can only be appreciated by those who <lb/>view this scene. In order
                    to perpetuate the me<lb break="no"/>mory of Mr Cox's services, the Governor
                        deem<lb break="no"/>ed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name
                    <lb/>to this grand and extraordinary pass, and he ac<lb break="no"/>cordingly
                    called it Cox's Pass. Having descend<lb break="no"/>ed into a valley at the
                    bottom of this pass, the <lb/>retrospective view of the overhanging mountain
                    <lb/>is magnificently grand. Although the present <lb/>pass is the only
                    practicable point yet discovered <lb/>for descending by, yet the mountain is
                    much <lb/>higher than those on either side of it, from <lb/>whence it is
                    distinguished at a considerable dis<lb break="no"/>tance, when approaching it
                    from the interior, <lb/>and in this point of view it has the appearance <lb/>of
                    a very high distinct hill, although it is in fact <lb/>only the abrupt
                    termination of a ridge. The <lb/>Governor gave the name of Mount York to this
                    <lb/>termination of the ridge, in honour of his Royal <lb/>Highness the Duke of
                    York.</p>
                <p>On descending Cox' Pass, the Governor was <lb/>much gratified by the appearance
                    of good pas<lb break="no"/>ture land and soil fit for cultivation, which was
                    <lb/>the first he had met with since the commencement <lb/>of his tour. The
                    valley at the base of Mount <lb/>York he called the Vale of Clwyd, in conse<lb
                        break="no"/>quence of the strong resemblance it bore to the <lb/>vale of
                    that name in North Wales. The grass <lb/>in this vale is of a good quality, and
                    very [?]<lb break="no"/>dant, and a rivulet of fine water runs along it
                    <lb/>from the eastward, which unites itself at the <lb/>western extremity of the
                    vale with another ri<lb break="no"/>vulet containing still more water. The
                    junction <lb/>of these two streams forms a very handsome river, <lb/>now called
                    by the Governor, Cox's River, which <lb/>takes its course, as has been since
                    ascertained <lb/>through the Prince Regent's Glen, and empties <lb/>itself into
                    the river Nepean ; and it is conjec<lb break="no"/>tured, from the nature of the
                    country through <lb/>which it passes, that it mut be one of the prin<lb
                        break="no"/>cipal causes of the floods which have been occa<lb break="no"
                    />sionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkes<lb break="no"/>bury, into
                    which the Nepean discharges itself. <lb/>The Vale of Clwyd, from the base of
                    Mount <lb/>York, extends six miles in a westerly direction, <lb/>and has its
                    termination at Cox's River. West<lb break="no"/>ward of this river the country
                    again becomes <lb/>hilly, but it is generally open forest land, and <lb/>very
                    good passage.</p>
                <p>Three miles to the westward of the Vale of <lb/>Clwyd, Messrs Blaxland,
                    Wentworth, and Law<lb break="no"/>son, had formerly terminated their excursion ;
                    <lb/>and when the various difficulties are consider<lb break="no"/>ed which they
                    had to contend with, especially <lb/>until they had effected the descent from
                    Mount <lb/>York, to which place they were obliged to pass <lb/>through a thick
                    brush-wood, where they were <lb/>under the necessity of cutting a passage for
                    <lb/>their baggage horses, the severity of which <lb/>labour had seriously
                    affected their healths, <lb/>their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot
                    <lb/>fail to excite much surprise and admiration. <lb/>In commemoration of their
                    merits, three beauti<lb break="no"/>ful high hills, joining each other at the
                    end of <lb/>their tour at this place, have receieved their <lb/>names in the
                    following order, viz. Mount Blax<lb break="no"/>land, Wentworth's Sugar Loaf,
                    and Lawson's <lb/>Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and <lb/>narrow
                    vallies alternately form the track of <lb/>country from Cox's River, for a
                    distance of 16 <lb/>miles, until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the
                    <lb/>stage between these rivers is consequently very <lb/>severe and oppressive
                    on the cattle. To this <lb/>range the Governor gave the name of Clarence
                    <lb/>Hilly Range.</p>
                <p>Proceeding from the Fish River, and at a short <lb/>distance from it, a very
                    singular and beautiful <lb/>mountain attracts the attentions, its summit be<lb
                        break="no"/>ing crowned with a large and very extraordinary <lb/>looking
                    rock, nearly circular in form, which <lb/>gives the whole very much the
                    appearance of <lb/>a hill fort, such as are frequent in India. To <lb/>this
                    lofty hill Mr Evans, who was the first Eu<lb break="no"/>ropean discoverer, gave
                    the name of Mount <lb/>Evans. Passing on from hence the country con<lb
                        break="no"/>tinues hilly, but affords good pasturage, gradu<lb break="no"
                    />ally improving to Sidmouth Valley, which is <lb/>distant from the pass of the
                    Fish RIver eight <lb/>miles. The land here is level, and the first met <lb/>with
                    unencumbered with timber. It is not of <lb/>very considerable extent, but
                    abounds with a <lb/>great variety of herbs and plants, such as would
                    <lb/>probably highly interest and gratify the scientific <lb/>botanist. The
                    beautiful little valley runs north<lb break="no"/>west and south-east, between
                    hills of easy ascent, <lb/>thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth
                    <lb/>Valley, the country becomes again hilly, and in <lb/>other respects
                    resembles very much the country <lb/>to the eastward of the valley for some
                    miles. <lb/>Having reached Campbell River, distant 13 miles <lb/>from Sidmouth
                    Valley, the Governor was high<lb break="no"/>ly gratified by the appearance of
                    the country, <lb/>which there began to exhibity an open and ex<lb break="no"
                    />tensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile <lb/>plains. Judging from
                    the height of the banks, <lb/>and its general width, the Campbell River must
                    <lb/>be on some occasions of very considerable mag<lb break="no"/>nitude ; but
                    the extraordinary drought which <lb/>has apparently prevailed on the western
                    side of <lb/>the mountains, equally as throughout this colony <cb/>
                    <lb/>for the last three years, has reduced this river <lb/>so much, that it may
                    be more properly called a <lb/>chain of pools than a running stream at the
                        pre<lb break="no"/>sent time. In the reaches or pools of the Camp<lb
                        break="no"/>bell River, the very curious animal called the <lb/>Paradox, or
                    Water Mole, is seen in great num<lb break="no"/>bers. The soil on both banks is
                    uncommonly <lb/>rich, and the grass is consequently luxuriant. <lb/>Two miles to
                    the southward of the line of road <lb/>which crosses the Campbell River, there
                    is a <lb/>very fine rich track of low lands, which has been <lb/>named Mitchell
                    Plains. Flax was found here <lb/>growing in considerable quanities. The Fish
                    <lb/>River, which forms a junction with the Campbell <lb/>River a few miles to
                    the northward of the road <lb/>and bridge over the latter, has also two very
                    <lb/>fertile plains on its banks, the one called O'Con<lb break="no"/>nel
                    Plains, and the other Macquarrie Plains, both <lb/>of considerable extent, and
                    very capable of yield<lb break="no"/>ing all the necessities of life.</p>
                <p>At the distance of seven miles from the bridge <lb/>over the Campbell River,
                    Bathurst Plains open <lb/>to the view, presenting a rich track of cham<lb
                        break="no"/>paign country of 11 miles in length, bounded on <lb/>both sides
                    by gently rising and very beautiful <lb/>hills, thinly wooded. The Macquarrie
                    River, <lb/>which is constituted by the junction of the Fish <lb/>and Campbell
                    River, takes a winding course <lb/>through the Plains, which can be easily
                    traced <lb/>from the high lands ajoining, by the particular <lb/>verdure of the
                    trees on its banks, which are like<lb break="no"/>wise the only trees throughout
                    the extent of the <lb/>plains. The level and clean surface of these <lb/>plains
                    gives them at first view very much the <lb/>appearance of lands in a state of
                    cultivation.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to behold this grand scene <lb/>without a feeling of admiration
                    and surprise, <lb/>whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a <lb/>space
                    of such extent and beauty as seems design<lb break="no"/>ed by Nature for the
                    occupancy and comfort of <lb/>man created a degree of melancholy in the mind
                    <lb/>which may be more easily imagined than de<lb break="no"/>scribed.</p>
                <p>The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains <lb/>on Thursday the 4th of May,
                    and encamped on <lb/>the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie
                    <lb/>River&#x2013;the situation being selected in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of
                    its commanding a beautiful and exten<lb break="no"/>sive prospect for many miles
                    in every direction <lb/>around it. At this place the Governor remained <lb/>for
                    a week, which time he occupied in making <lb/>excursions in different directions
                    through the <lb/>adjoining country, on both sides the river.</p>
                <p>On Sunday, the 7th of May, the Governor <lb/>fixed on a site suitable for the
                    erection of a town <lb/>at some future period, to which he gave the name <lb/>of
                    Bathurst, in honour of the present Secretary <lb/>of State for the Colonies. The
                    situation of Ba<lb break="no"/>thurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach
                    <lb/>of any floods which may occur, and is at the <lb/>same time so near to the
                    river on its south bank <lb/>as to derive all the advantages of its clear and
                    <lb/>beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of <lb/>whatever description
                    who may be hereafter per<lb break="no"/>mitted to form permanent residences to
                        them<lb break="no"/>selves at this place will have the highly import<lb
                        break="no"/>ant advantages of a rich and fertile soil, with a <lb/>beautiful
                    river flowing through it, for all the uses <lb/>of man. The Governor mut however
                    add, that <lb/>the hopes which were once so sanguinely enter<lb break="no"
                    />tained of this river becoming navigable to the <lb/>Western Sea have ended in
                    disappointment.</p>
                <p>During the week that the Governor remained <lb/>at Bathurst he made daily
                    excursions in various <lb/>directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a
                    <lb/>south-west direction, and on that occasion, as <lb/>well as on all the
                    others, he found the country <lb/>chiefly composed of vallies and plains,
                    separated <lb/>occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil <lb/>throughout
                    being generally fertile, and well cir<lb break="no"/>cumstanced for the purpose
                    of agriculture or <lb/>grazing.</p>
                <p>The Governor here feels much pleasure in be<lb break="no"/>ing enabled to
                    communicate to the public that <lb/>the favourable reports which he had received
                    of <lb/>the country to the west of the Blue Mountains <lb/>have not been by any
                    means exaggerated. The <lb/>difficulties which present themselves in the jour<lb
                        break="no"/>ney from hence are certainly great and inevi<lb break="no"
                    />table, but thsoe persons who may be inclined to <lb/>become permanent settlers
                    there will probably con<lb break="no"/>tent themselves withvisiting this part of
                    the colony <lb/>but rarely, and of course will have them seldom <lb/>to
                    encounter. Plenty of water, and a sufficien<lb break="no"/>cy of grass are to be
                    found in the mountains for <lb/>the support of such cattle as may be sent over
                    <lb/>them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pas<lb break="no"/>turage
                    which the new country affords are fully <lb/>extensive enough for any increase
                    of population <lb/>and stock which can possibly take place for ma<lb break="no"
                    />ny years.</p>
                <p>Within a distance of ten miles from the site of <lb/>Bathurst there is not less
                    than 50,000 acres of <lb/>land clear of timber, and fully one half of that
                    <lb/>may be considered excellent soil, well calculated <lb/>for cultivation. It
                    is a matter of regrets that in <lb/>proportion as the soil improves the timber
                        dege<lb break="no"/>nerates ; and it is to be remarked, that every<lb
                        break="no"/>where to the westward of the mountains it is <lb/>much inferior
                    both in size and quality to that <lb/>within the present colony ; there is,
                    however, a <lb/>sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within <lb/>the
                    district around Bathurst for the purposes of <lb/>house-building and
                    husbandry.</p>
                <p>The Governor has here to lament that neither <lb/>coals nor limestone have been
                    yet discovered in <lb/>the western country ; articles in themselves of <lb/>so
                    much importance, that the want of them must <lb/>be severely felt whenever that
                    country shall <lb/>be settled.</p>
                <p>Having enumerated the principal and most im<lb break="no"/>portant features of
                    this new country, the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor has now to notice some of its
                    live produc<lb break="no"/>tions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety
                    <lb/>of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a <lb/>great quantity of
                    fish, but all of one denomina<lb break="no"/>tion, resembling the perch in
                    appearance, and of <lb/>a delicate and fine flavour, not unlike that of a
                    <lb/>rock cod. This fish grows to a large size, and <lb/>is very voracious.
                    Several of them were caught <lb/>during the Governor's stay at Bathurst, and at
                    <lb/>the halting place on the Fish River. One of <lb/>those caught weight 17 lb
                    ; and the people <lb/>stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught
                    <lb/>some weighing 25 lb.</p>
                <p>The field game are the kangaroos, emus, black <lb/>swans, wild geese, wild
                    turkies, bustards, ducks <lb/>of various kinds, quail, bronze, and other pi<lb
                        break="no"/>geons, &amp;c. &amp;c. The water mole, or paradox, <lb/>also
                    abounds in all the rivers and ponds.</p>
                <p>The site designed for the towns of Bathurst, by <lb/>observation taken at the
                    Flag Staff, which was <lb/>erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that
                    <lb/>name, is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south, <lb/>being also 27 1/2
                    miles north of Government House, <lb/>In Sydney, and 94 1/2 west of it, bearing
                    west 20. <lb/>30. north, 83 geographic miles, or 95 1/2 statute <lb/>miles ; the
                    measured road distance from Sydney <lb/>to Bathurst being 140 English miles.</p>
                <p>The road constructed by Mr Cox, and the <cb/>
                    <lb/>party under him, commences at Emu Ford, on <lb/>the left bank of the river
                    Nepean, and is thence <lb/>carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst.
                    <lb/>This road has been carefully measured, and each <lb/>mile regularly marked
                    on the trees growing on <lb/>the left side of the road proceeding towards Ba<lb
                        break="no"/>thurst.</p>
                <p>The Governor in his tour made the following <lb/>stages, in which he was
                    principally regulated by <lb/>the consideration of having good pasturage for
                    <lb/>the cattle, and plenty of water :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>1st stage&#x2013;Spring Wood, distant from Emu Ford 12 miles <lb/>2d stage

                <p>At all of which places the traveller may as<lb break="no"/>sure himself of good
                    grass, and water in abun<lb break="no"/>dance.</p>
                <p>On Thursday, the 11th of May, the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor and suite set out from
                    Bathurst on their <lb/>return, and arrived at Sidney on Friday the <lb/>19th
                    Ult.</p>
                <p>The Governor deems it expedient here to no<lb break="no"/>tify to the public,
                    that he does not mean to make <lb/>any grants of land to the westward of the
                    Blue <lb/>Mountains, until he shall receive the commands <lb/>of his Majesty's
                    Ministers on that subject, and <lb/>in reply to the report he is now about to
                    make <lb/>them upon it.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, such gentlemen or other <lb/>respectable free persons as may
                    wish to visit this <lb/>new country will be permitted to do so, on mak<lb
                        break="no"/>ing a written application to the Governor to that <lb/>effect,
                    who will order them to be furnished with <lb/>written passes. It is at the same
                    time strictly or<lb break="no"/>dered and directed that no person, whether civil
                    <lb/>or military, shall attempt to travel over the Blue <lb/>Mountains without
                    having previously applied for <lb/>and obtained permission, in the above

                <p>Montreal, Oct. 5. <lb/>On the afternoon of Saturday last, the specie <lb/>seized
                    on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat, <lb/>amounting to upward of 12,000
                    dollars, arrived <lb/>at his Majesty's cash-office here, under the es<lb
                        break="no"/>cort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's.</p>
                <p>At length we have authentic accounts relating <lb/>to the expedition of Lord
                    Selkirk ; they are very <lb/>important, as many <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi>
                    details have been <lb/>published - his taking Fort William by storm, <lb/>making
                    all the partners of the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany prisoners, &amp;c. ;
                    but the cause of the expe <lb/>dition has never been explained. The Canadian
                    <lb/>Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:&#x2013; <lb/>Mr Robert
                    Semple, the Governor-General <lb/>The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River,
                    <lb/>towards the close of the year 1815, took posses<lb break="no"/>sion of two
                    establishments belonging to the North <lb/>West Company, which had obtruded
                    themselves <lb/>on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. <lb/>The North
                    West traders then altered their <lb/>route, going into the Upper Country by
                        circuit<lb break="no"/>ous ways, by which much delay took place ; and
                    <lb/>in order to try Mr Semple, they sent two cart<lb break="no"/>loads of
                    provisions by the former track in June <lb/>last, with a guard of fifty men ;
                    the advance, <lb/>twenty-two of the number, fell in with one of <lb/>the
                    natives, whom they took forward with them <lb/>to prevent discovery. The
                    rear-guard passed <lb/>within four miles of the settlement ; they were
                    <lb/>perceived by the Governor, and were attacked <lb/>by a party from the
                    garrison, consisting of about <lb/>thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place,
                        stat<lb break="no"/>ed on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 <lb/>of his men
                    were killed ; the rest of his forces <lb/>returned defeated to the fort ; it is
                    on this ac<lb break="no"/>count that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was
                    <lb/>undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's con<lb break="no"/>ducting the
                    expedition we do not justify, nor in<lb break="no"/>deed can we form any opinion
                    on the subject <lb/>without further authentic details ; it is, however, <lb/>but
                    justice to say, that the Hudson's Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany have rights, and
                    are a chartered Company ; <lb/>the North West Traders, though we believe a
                    <lb/>most respectable body, are only an Association <lb/>of Merchants.</p>

                    Governor Semple, <lb/>killed by a party of <hi rend="italic">half-breeds,</hi>
                    the spurious offspring of the <lb/>North West Company. As yet have not had an
                    accurate <lb/>statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party
                    <lb/>state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>pany servants, came to destroy the settlement, and that Mr <lb/>Semple,
                    with about 25 of the Colonists, went out to meet them, <lb/>to know what could
                    be their intentions, when those rascals com<lb break="no"/>menced firing on
                    them, and massacred all but three, who were for<lb break="no"/>tunate enough to
                    make their escape. The North West people's <lb/>account is that these <hi
                        rend="italic">half-breeds</hi> with some <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi> were
                        bring<lb break="no"/>ing down provisions from the upper part of the Red
                    River to the <lb/>entrance near Lake Winipie, and as the Colonists had the
                        com<lb break="no"/>mand of a great part of the river, they were obliged to
                    pass in the <lb/>rear of the settlement, which being observed by Governor Sem<lb
                        break="no"/>ple, who was on the look-out for them, he settled out of his
                    Fort <lb/>with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the pro<lb
                        break="no"/>visions which were intended for the North West Company ; that
                    <lb/>the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of <lb/>the
                    Colonists, of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk <lb/>[?] from Montreal

                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to America</hi>.</p>
                <p>[ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register, published on <lb/>Saturday, 12th
                    instant ].</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cobbett's arrival in America</hi>,&amp;c.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday evening, the 27th March, <lb/>we embarked on board the Importer, D.
                    <lb/>Ogden, master, bound to New York, where we <lb/>arrived on the 5th of May,
                    with about 40 steer<lb break="no"/>age passengers, farmers, and tradesmen, who
                    <lb/>were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all re<lb break="no"/>spects that
                    can be named our passage disa<lb break="no"/>greeable, and upon one occasion
                    very perilous, <lb/>from lightning, which struck the ship twice, <lb/>shivered
                    two of the masts, killed a man, struck <lb/>several people slightly, between two
                    of whom I <lb/>was sitting, without at all feeling the blow.</p>
                <p>Some of our fellow-passengers have found <lb/>great disappointment ; and, it is
                    stated in some <lb/>of the public papers here, that many hundreds <lb/>have,
                    during the last year, accepted of the offer <lb/>of our Consul at New York to go
                    and settle in <lb/>Canada. You know that I have never advised any <lb/>body to
                    emigrate. I have always said that it is <lb/>no place for manufacturers ; no
                    place for men to <lb/>live without work ; no place for a farmer who <lb/>does
                    not work himself ; no place in short, for <lb/>any one who is not able and
                    willing to work <lb/>at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such <lb/>men there
                    is every where a plentiful, happy, <lb/>and easy life. None should come,
                    however, <lb/>who have any views of idleness ; and even <lb/>for the industrious
                    poor, I see no reason why <lb/>they should expend their last shilling, and
                        under<lb break="no"/>go all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage,
                    <lb/>in order to save those who eat the taxes the ex<lb break="no"/>pence of
                    their share of poor-rates ; a man and <lb/>his wife and a child or two cannot
                    come under <lb/>the expence of 35 guineas, at least. A single <lb/>man 20
                    guineas, before he gets into work again ; <lb/>and, as I always said, I never
                    would, if I were <lb/>in the place of such a man, expend my earnings <lb/>on a
                    sea voyage, and endure all its hardships, <lb/>in order to remove one eye sore
                    out of the way <lb/>of corruption. Besides, there is the climate, <lb/>which is
                    not so good as ours, though it is not <lb/>bad, and people often live to an old
                    age. The <lb/>country is good, but it will easily be conceived, <lb/>that new
                    face, an entire new scene, a separa<lb break="no"/>tion from every friend, work
                    done in a quite dif<lb break="no"/>ferent way from it is in England ; it will
                    <lb/>easily be conceived, that all this makes such a <lb/>dislocation in a man's
                    mind as to make him very <lb/>unhappy for a while. Then, he cannot expect
                    <lb/>to find work the first day. He must ask first, at <lb/>any rate. Englishmen
                    are sheepish ; and, they <lb/>are sure to find rascals enough here to foster
                    <lb/>their disgust, merely for the sake of serving the <lb/>cause of corruption
                    at home. In short, I advice <lb/>nobody to emigrate, but I will truly describe
                    <lb/>the country and the people. As to emigrating with <lb/>a view of settling
                    and farming in the new countries, <lb/>it is neither more nor less than
                    downright mad<lb break="no"/>ness. It is what our English farmers know no<lb
                        break="no"/>thing at all about ; it is what they are not at all <lb/>fit for
                    ; and the far greater part of all such spe<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>culations end in disappointment, if not in ruin <lb/>and premature death. I
                    hope that our beloved <lb/>country will shortly be fit for an honest and in<lb
                        break="no"/>dustrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come <lb/>with
                    money in their pockets, my advice is, not <lb/>to give way either to
                    enthusiastic admiration, or <lb/>to instant disgust. But, to stop a little ; to
                    look <lb/>about them ; to see not only after good land, but <lb/>a good market
                    for its products. The western <lb/>romance writers tell us, that the land in the
                    <lb/>Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish, in his valu<lb break="no"/>able book,
                    tells us, that beef and pork sell for <lb/>three halfpence a pound. An excellent
                        coun<lb break="no"/>try for people who want to do nothing but eat. &#x2013;
                    <lb/>Give me Long Island, where the land is not too <lb/>good ; but where beef
                    and pork sell for about <lb/>eightpence a pound (I speak of English money);
                    <lb/>where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and <lb/>where there is a
                    ready market for every species of <lb/>produce. One thing above all ; if an
                    English far<lb break="no"/>mer (I mean by English, people of the whole of
                    <lb/>the United Kingdom) comes here, with money <lb/>in his pocket, let him
                    resolve to keep it there for <lb/>a year, and then he will be sure to do well.
                    &#x2013; <lb/>All that I see around me here is well calculated to <lb/>attract
                    the attention and to please the sight of one, <lb/>like myself, brought up in
                    the country, always <lb/>greatly delighted with, and somewhat skilled in,
                    <lb/>various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The <lb/>The people are engaged
                    busily in planting their In<lb break="no"/>dian corn. The cherry trees, of which
                    there are <lb/>multitudes, planted in long avenues or rows, or <lb/>round the
                    fields, have dropped their blossom and <lb/>begin to show their loads of fruit.
                    The apple <lb/>and pear orchards, in extent from one to twenty <lb/>acres on
                    each farm, are in full and beautiful <lb/>bloom. The farms are small in extent ;
                    no ap<lb break="no"/>pearance of want amongst the labourers, who re<lb
                        break="no"/>ceive, in the country, about two shillings and <lb/>threepence
                    (our money) a-day, with board and <lb/>lodging, and which board consists of
                    plenty of <lb/>excellent meat and fish of all sorts, the best of <lb/>bread,
                    butter, cheese, and eggs. That you may <lb/>form some idea as to prices of
                    living, I will state <lb/>a few facts, which have already come within my
                    <lb/>own knowledge. We are at present at an inn, <lb/>thirteen miles from New
                    York. It is on the <lb/>road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the <lb/>day
                    passes without a carriage of some sort offer<lb break="no"/>ing for going
                    thither, and to go by the regular <lb/>stage costs three shillings. Mind, I
                    shall al<lb break="no"/>ways speak in English money, when I do not <lb/>speak of
                    dollars. We lodge and board in <lb/>this inn, have each a bed-room and good
                    <lb/>bed, have a room to sit in ourselves ; <lb/>we eat by ourselves ; and it
                    really is eating. <lb/>&#x2013; We have smoked fish, chops, butter, and eggs,
                    <lb/>for breakfast, with bread (the very finest I ever <lb/>sa), crackers, sweet
                    cakes ; and when I say <lb/>that we have such and such things, I do not
                    <lb/>mean that we get them for show, or just enough <lb/>to smell to ; but in
                    loads. Not an egg, but a <lb/>dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ;
                    <lb/>but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and cof<lb break="no"/>fee ; not
                    broke into little bits the size of a hazle <lb/>nut, but in good thumping
                    pieces. For dinner, <lb/>we have the finest of fish, bass, mackerel, lob<lb
                        break="no"/>sters ; of meat, lamb, veal, ham &amp;c. ; aspara<lb break="no"
                    />gus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle <lb/>of May). The supper
                    is like the breakfast, with <lb/>preserved peaches and other things. And with
                    <lb/>all this an excellent cyder to drink, with the <lb/>kindest and most
                    obliging treatment, on the part <lb/>of the landlord and landlady, and their
                    sons and <lb/>daughters, we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week <lb/>each. In
                    England the same food and drink and <lb/>lodging at an inn would cost us nearly
                    the same <lb/>sum every day. But there are two things which <lb/>no money can
                    purchase any where. The first is, <lb/>no grumbling on the part of the landlady,
                    except <lb/>on account of our eating and drinking too little ; <lb/>and the
                    other is, that Mr Wiggins has no fasten<lb break="no"/>ing but a bit of chip run
                    in over the latch of the <lb/>door, to a house which is full of valuable things
                    <lb/>of all sorts, and about which we leave all our things <lb/>much more
                    carelessly than we should do in our <lb/>own house in any part of England. Here,
                    then <lb/>are we able to live at an inn, one of the most <lb/>respectable in the
                    whole country, at the rate of <lb/>fifty pounds a year, while the pay of a
                    common <lb/>farming man is not much short of that sum.</p>

                <p>The authenticity of the following details of the <lb/>miseries endured by some
                    German emigrants <lb/>proceeding from Amsterdam to America is, we <lb/>are told,
                    guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost <lb/>too shocking to admit to belief
                    :</p>
                <p>"Libson, Nov. 4</p>
                <p>"We have just been witnesses here of an <lb/>event which has renewed those gloomy
                    reflexions <lb/>which the friends of humanity have indulged ever <lb/>since the
                    commencement of the emigration from <lb/>Germany and Switzerland to America. We
                    have <lb/>deplored the error which led so great a number <lb/>of unhappy persons
                    to expartiate themselves in <lb/>the hope of finding a happier lot upon the
                    shores <lb/>of the new world. But it is less to the blindness <lb/>of the
                    victims of this error, than to the abomi<lb break="no"/>nable speculations of
                    cupidity that we are to <lb/>attribute these numerous emigrations.</p>
                <p>"the misery of the people of Germany and <lb/>Switzerland, occasioned by a
                    superabundance of <lb/>population, and by the bad harvests of late years,
                    <lb/>serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men, <lb/>who seek to
                    establish criminal projects upon <lb/>bases almost as obnoxious as those of the
                    former <lb/>slave trade. Such calculations deserve the atten<lb break="no"/>tion
                    of Governments, and it is with this view that <lb/>we think is our duty to make
                    known the fate of <lb/>an expedition of this kind, fitted out at Amster<lb
                        break="no"/>dam last August.</p>
                <p>"But we shall first transcribe, from the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal, the article of
                    the charter party relative to <lb/>the power reserved by the Captain over the
                        per<lb break="no"/>sons of the passengers, as inlcuding stipulations
                    <lb/>which are most characteristic of the nature of that <lb/>odious traffic
                    :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"We passengers, promise to fulfil faithfully the follow<lb break="no"/>ing
                    conditions:&#x2013; With respect to the price of the passage <lb/>above
                    stipulated, for so much as we have not yet paid, we en<lb break="no"/>gage to
                    gain by our labour in America, what we owe, and we <lb/>who owe the whole amount
                    of our passage are bound, if re<lb break="no"/>quired, and if we are unable to
                    find better conditions, to hire <lb/>ourselves for four or five years, in order
                    to pay for our pas<lb break="no"/>sage ; and we who have only paid for a part of
                    our passage, <lb/>equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time
                    <lb/>for the sum we still owe.</p>
                <p>"We promise besides, we passengers, men or women, fa<lb break="no"/>thers or
                    mothers, children and families here assembled, the <lb/>children for their
                    parents, the parents for their children, the <lb/>brother for his brother, and
                    the sister for her sister, when <lb/>we shall find an opportunity to employ
                    ourselves in America, <lb/>to engage ourselves in service, and to answer for one
                    for the other <lb/>one for all the others, whether he be of our family or not,
                    so <lb/>that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as <lb/>much as
                    shall be necessary, until we all and our families have <lb/>employment, and the
                    captain be no loser by us ; knowing very <lb/>well that we passengers who have
                    children, a family, brothers, <lb/>and sisters, ought all to sumbit to our wives
                    or husbands, our <lb/>children, our brothers, our sisters, being sent separately
                    to <lb/>whatever place, in order to gain, in private service, profession,
                    <lb/>or labour, or in any manner that shall be deemed best, the <lb/>price of
                    our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case <lb/>refused the
                    engagements proposed to us, or contract others <lb/>without the permission not
                    knowledge of the capain, it is agreed <lb/>for those who have not yet paid for
                    their passage, for those <lb/>who still owe part, and for those who cannot find
                    an en<lb break="no"/>gagement, that they must consent to me, the captain,
                    carrying <lb/>them to such place in America as it shall please me, and
                    <lb/>wherever I may find it expedient to proceed, or wherever it <lb/>may suit
                    me to sail."</p>
                <p>"These horrible conditions were signed by <lb/>300 passengers. They had
                    contracted with the <lb/>Captain of a Dutch ship, which was to proceed
                    <lb/>first to Baltimore. She in the worst state <lb/>when she sailed from
                    Amsterdam, and in de<lb break="no"/>fiance of the clauses of the contract, by
                    which <lb/>the Captain had engaged to feed them properly <lb/>during the voyage,
                    he had not even embarked <lb/>the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for, after
                    <lb/>62 days navigation, the leaks had so gained upon <lb/>the ship, that she
                    was in danger of sinking, and <lb/>famine had already made frightful ravages. It
                    <lb/>was at the end of that time, and in this deplo <lb/>rable condition, that
                    she was forced into Belem, <lb/>near Lisbon.</p>
                <p>"Long before her arrival on our coasts, the <lb/>passengers had been reduced to
                    the greatest mi<lb break="no"/>sery, not more by the small quantity than by the
                    <lb/>bad quality of the provisions. The water was <lb/>gone, and sea-water was
                    their only drink. So <lb/>much had they been wasted, that forty had al<lb
                        break="no"/>ready died of famine. Among the rest there <lb/>were a great
                    many sick, some of who have died <lb/>since their arrival in Portugal.</p>
                <p>"The situation of the vessel had at first given <lb/>great alarm to our Council
                    of Health, who, ap<lb break="no"/>prehensive of contagion, were for an instant
                        fear<lb break="no"/>ful that it would be necessary to force her out <lb/>to
                    sea. That would have been a misery so much <lb/>the more formidable, because the
                    ship was not in <lb/>a state to keep the sea, and all must infallibly <lb/>have
                    perished. Happily this was deemed unne<lb break="no"/>cessary, and a quarantine
                    was ordered. The Re<lb break="no"/>gency of Lisbon determined that provisions
                    and <lb/>other succours should be furnished at the ex<lb break="no"/>pence of
                    the State. All the Consuls were most <lb/>active and benevolent in affording
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>"Such was the result of the expedition. <lb/>Many others have, no doubt, answered
                    as little <lb/>the expectations of those who, seduced by de<lb break="no"
                    />ceitful promises have emigrated to America in <lb/>search of happiness which
                    they could not find, <lb/>abandoning their country, their parents, and
                    <lb/>their friends. In July, a Hamburgh ship, with <lb/>106 Swiss passengers,
                    was at Lisbon, in nearly the <lb/>same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said
                    <lb/>here that there is a company in Holland which <lb/>has numerous agents to
                    seduce men to emigrate. <lb/>It heaps them pell mell on board ships, and if
                    <lb/>they reach their destination, they are soon con<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes.</p>
                <p>"It would be a desirable thing for papers, in <lb/>countries where these
                    emigrations are excited, <lb/>to insert the article relative to the charter
                        par<lb break="no"/>ty, given above, in order that the simple <lb/>and
                    credulous may see what they have to un<lb break="no"/>dergo."</p>

                <p>"The following most daring instance of piracy <lb/>was committed in our harbour
                    on the 11th inst. <lb/>viz.&#x2013; The Elizabeth, White, lying at anchor off
                    <lb/>Robin Island, with about 120 tons of oil on board, <lb/>was boarded at
                    about one <hi rend="smallcaps">a. m.</hi> by a party of <lb/>armed deserters
                    from his Majesty's 10th regi<lb break="no"/>ment, and convicts, about 12 in

                    <lb/>five soldiers and seven convicts, who, after se<lb break="no"/>curing the
                    hatches, &amp;c. obtained possession of <lb/>the ship, and in the same instant
                    cut the cables, <lb/>loosed the sails, and favoured by a strong S. E. <lb/>wind,
                    succeeded in carrying her off, at six <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi>
                    <lb/>The captain and crew having refused to listen to <lb/>their invitation to
                    join them in their piratical un<lb break="no"/>dertaking, with the exception of
                    the mate, were <lb/>permitted to leave the ship in the boat, which <lb/>reached
                    Robin Island in safety about four o'clock <lb/>the same day.</p>
                <p>"By a letter received to-day we learn that <lb/>the Admiral Gambier, Brash, laden
                    with Govern<lb break="no"/>ment stores for Ceylon, was totally lost on the

                <p>A letter from Halifax, dated the 27th No<lb break="no"/>nember, says &#x2013; "
                    Colonel Bouchette, Surveyor- <lb/>General of Lower Canada, with Captain Camp<lb

                    here on the 19th inst. The only in<lb break="no"/>formation I can yet give you
                    is, that the exploring <lb/>survey has been extended from the source of the
                    <lb/>St Croix river to the river Restigouche, in line <lb/>about 100 miles ; in
                    this short distance both par<lb break="no"/>ties experienced difficulties and
                    sufferings of the <lb/>severest nature. The Americans employed on <lb/>the same
                    line with our English Commissioners <lb/>are represented as men of great
                    ability, and act<lb break="no"/>ing with that spirit of liberality that infuses
                        con<lb break="no"/>fidence on each side, rendering their arduous <lb/>task
                    less severe and gloomy than was to have <lb/>been expected in thie untrodden
                    wilds of this <lb/>quarter. Our trade continues dull, and money <lb/>scarce.
                    Government bills are 3 per cent ad<lb break="no"/>vance, but expected to be
                    lower, in consequence <lb/>of the Commissary-General having refused to <lb/>take
                    the provincial notes."</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard</hi>&#x2013;On Friday
                    <lb/>night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place <lb/>was thrown into the
                    greatest consternation, by <lb/>the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard,
                    <lb/>the beating of drums, and the firing of the men <lb/>of war's guns. It was
                    occasioned by a fire hav<lb break="no"/>ing broken out in the house belonging to
                    the <lb/>steam engine erected for carrying on the new <lb/>works situated in the
                    southern part of the dock- <lb/>yard, near the kilns used for burning cement
                    <lb/>stone. The most serious apprehensions were <lb/>entertained for the safety
                    of the arsenal ; and <lb/>what was more distressing to the feelings of the
                    <lb/>spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, <lb/>which, from the
                    pressure of the times and want <lb/>of employment, is crowded with many
                        unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate individuals. Providence, however, averted
                    <lb/>the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock <lb/>we had the pleasure of
                    seeing the raging flames <lb/>subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house.
                    <lb/>No lives, it is understood, have been lost, but <lb/>one poor man is
                    severely hurt. Captain Walker <lb/>of the Northumberland, and the officers of
                    that <lb/>ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and <lb/>Captain Brown and
                    the officers of the Ordinary, <lb/>with the military officers and soldiers of
                    the gar<lb break="no"/>rison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter <lb/>were
                    under arms the whole time, and were of <lb/>great service in keeping off the
                    spectators. The <lb/>inhabitants of the twon were at one time under <lb/>serious
                    apprehensions, as the fire was not far <lb/>from the Fountain tavern, and the
                    residence of <lb/>Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the <lb/>landlady of
                    the house had but recently lain in, <lb/>and was removed on the first alarm
                    being given. <lb/>Sir Robert Barlow, from Chatham, who superin<lb break="no"
                    />tends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, <lb/>was here yesterday to
                    investiage into the cause, <lb/>which it is suspected arose from carlessness
                    &#x2013; <lb/>The damage, however, has not been so great as <lb/>was at first
                    expected, and which it might have been <lb/>but for the prompt and effectual
                    assistance that <lb/>was given &#x2013; <hi rend="italic">Sheerness,

                <p><pb/>New York and other American papers have <lb/>been received to the 20th
                    December: &#x2013; In the <lb/>house of Representatives, on the 9th, Mr John<lb

                <p>"That the military peace establishment of the United <lb/>States shall consist
                    hereafter of eight thousand men, including <lb/>the corps of invalids. Provided
                    that the corps of engineers, <lb/>the General Staff and Ordnance Department
                    shall be re<lb break="no"/>tained, as at present established. Provided also,

                        pro<lb break="no"/>vide by law for an additional national armoury, to be
                    located <lb/>on the western waters. That it is expedient to organise by <lb/>law
                    a corps of invalids, to be composed of one thousand <lb/>men."</p>
                <p>The following resolution relative to foreign <lb/>seamen was also proposed, and

                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Irish Emigrants</hi>. <lb/>New York, Nov. 27.</p>
                <p>Nothing scarcely can be conceived more <lb/>distressing than the situation of an
                        unfriend<lb break="no"/>ed stranger arrived here, from across the At<lb
                        break="no"/>lantic, without the means of helping himself, <lb/>and without
                    even enough of acquaintance with <lb/>the men and things about him to enable him
                    <lb/>to judge what path he should take to secure him <lb/>the miseries of
                    absolute want. Such, how<lb break="no"/>ever, is actually the situation of
                    hundres who <lb/>annually land on our shores. To provide for <lb/>those forlorn
                    beings, several attempts have been <lb/>made by associations of humane
                    individuals here, <lb/>but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising <lb/>as
                    that of which an account here follows: &#x2013;</p>
                <p>At a meeting of Irishmen, and descendents of Irishmen, <lb/>held at Harmony Hall,
                    on Tuesday the 25th instant, for <lb/>the purpose of promoting a Settlement of
                    Irish Emi<lb break="no"/>grants; <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Andrew Morris</hi>,
                    Chairman, <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">WM. Sampson</hi>, Secretary ;</p>
                <p>Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett, <lb/>the circular previously issues on
                    this subject was <lb/>read by the Secretary : &#x2013;</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Circular</hi>
                    <lb/>It is a sentiment long felt, and often express<lb break="no"/>ed, that
                    something should be undertaken on be<lb break="no"/>hald of the emigrants who
                    flock to these shores.</p>
                <p>Without any fixed destination, they remain in <lb/>the sea port, until beocming
                    victims of bad <lb/>counsel and bad example, they lose the pure and <lb/>honest
                    energies with which they left their native <lb/>land, and suffer worse than
                    shipwreck in their <lb/>moral qualities.</p>
                <p>The Government of this great Republic is well <lb/>aware of the advantage to be
                    derived from so <lb/>great a mass of laborious industry, when usefully
                    <lb/>directed and employed&#x2013;and of adding to the <lb/>nation's strength,
                    men whose attachment to the <lb/>institutions of this country is assured by so
                    many <lb/>ties. But it is in the order of things, that some <lb/>of the friends,
                    particularly the countrymen of <lb/>these emigrants, who have been some time
                        esta<lb break="no"/>blished and known, should come forward to at<lb
                        break="no"/>test the necessity, and guarantee the solidity of <lb/>the
                    enterprise.</p>
                <p>If his has not been done sooner, it is because <lb/>every advance in social
                    improvement must come <lb/>in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion,
                    <lb/>and the voice of the times that now speak.</p>
                <p>It has been remarked that among the lands <lb/>nows open for sale and settlement,
                    there are some <lb/>tracks, particularly in the Illionois territory, <lb/>where
                    the Irish emigrant, with the instruments <lb/>to which his hands are accustomed,
                    and in a cli<lb break="no"/>mate congenial to his habits, might procure to
                    <lb/>himself immediate shelter and subsistence&#x2013;and, <lb/>in a few years,
                    be able to repay with gratitude <lb/>the benefits conferred on him.</p>
                <p>We, whose names are undersigned, have met <lb/>to consult upon the means of
                    promoting some <lb/>establishment that might be a rallying point for <lb/>the
                    distressed, and give to the wanderer a habi<lb break="no"/>tation and a home. We
                    have thought of no bet<lb break="no"/>ter way than to address, by this circular,
                    the <lb/>friends and well wishers of Ireland, who co-ope<lb break="no"/>ration
                    might give most weight to the measure, <lb/>and to submit, whether it might not
                    be advisable <lb/>to join all our efforts, and petition Congress ear<lb
                        break="no"/>ly in the ensuing session, for a grant of a suit<lb break="no"
                    />able track, upon a credit of 14 or 15 years, sub<lb break="no"/>ject to such
                    conditions and modifications as the <lb/>Government may see most fitting.</p>
                <p>to the Government we would offer no decep<lb break="no"/>tive, delusive, or
                    precarious motive, rather chu<lb break="no"/>sing to make its wisdom, benignity,
                    and patriot<lb break="no"/>ism, the anchor of our hope.</p>
                <p>We request of our, if you approve of our sen<lb break="no"/>timent and of our
                    project, to advance and pro<lb break="no"/>mote it by your best endeavours ;
                    either by form<lb break="no"/>ing organized associations, or by obtaining
                        indi<lb break="no"/>vidual signatures, to a petition to the effect sta<lb
                        break="no"/>ted. We have not yet been able to digest a plan, <lb/>and have
                    rather chosen to make this humble be<lb break="no"/>ginning, in hopes that we
                    should soon receive <lb/>additional light upon the subject from cor<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>respondence we solicit. We shall, nevertheless, <lb/>proceed to investigate
                    the subject, and challenge <lb/>the co-operation of good and respectable men,
                    <lb/>and request of you to do the same.</p>

                    who called this meet<lb break="no"/>ing, to explain the objects for which it was
                        con<lb break="no"/>venued ; that it could not be necessary to expa<lb
                        break="no"/>tiate before those he was now addressin, on the <lb/>situation
                    of the peasantry and farmers in Ire<lb break="no"/>land ; it was at present one
                    of unqualified mise<lb break="no"/>try, partly occasioned by their local
                    oppressions, <lb/>and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; <lb/>it
                    compelled them to fly to these shores in such <lb/>numbers, and under the
                    pressure of so great po<lb break="no"/>verty, that the most active individual
                        benevo<lb break="no"/>levence could neither provide them with a sufficient
                    <lb/>present succour, nor procure for them, within a <lb/>reasonable time, the
                    means of permanent settle<lb break="no"/>ment. The consequence was, that many of
                    <lb/>those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to <lb/>this county, or
                    forced by want to become noxi<lb break="no"/>ous and dangerous to its cities,
                    whose original <lb/>dispositions and qualifications, if rightly direct<lb
                        break="no"/>ed and employed, would have made them valu<lb break="no"/>able
                    and useful members of the community. Be<lb break="no"/>sides, the accounts
                    transmitted back to Ireland <lb/>of their disappointments and destitute
                    situations, <lb/>deferred many who were suffering at home the <lb/>extreme of
                    wretchedness, from endeavouring to <lb/>better their condition in this more
                    fortunate and <lb/>favoured land&#x2013;to the political institutions of
                    <lb/>which they were also more strongly attached.</p>
                <p>A very painful reflection on these circumstan<lb break="no"/>ces had suggested to
                    come gentlemen then pre<lb break="no"/>sent the hope that the general Government
                    might <lb/>be induced, by a strong and united application, <lb/>to grant a
                    portion of its unsettled lands on terms <lb/>liberal and bountiful, so that an
                    asylum might be <lb/>formed for industrious and enterprising farmers, <lb/>who
                    would gladly fly from famine and persecu<lb break="no"/>tion to a spot where the
                    sweat of their brows fall<lb break="no"/>ing on a fertile soil would yield them
                    a rich har<lb break="no"/>vest, for their own exclusive benefit, and where
                    <lb/>they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of <lb/>that republication
                    liberty they loved. The time <lb/>for making such an application seemed
                        auspici<lb break="no"/>ous ; party asperities had softened fown, and
                    <lb/>probably few would now be led by political pre<lb break="no"/>judices to
                    give it opposition. Neither was it un<lb break="no"/>precedented ; a favour
                    nearly similar had been <lb/>granted to the French emigrants, and to settlers
                    <lb/>from Switzerland.</p>
                <p>It is true we could not forth a pretence <lb/>like the cultivation of the vine or
                    the olive ; and <cb/>
                    <lb/>we would not succeed by practising any delusion. <lb/>We could offer
                    nothing but an immediate accession <lb/>of industrious and hardy settlers, who
                    in a conge<lb break="no"/>nial soil and climate would become enthusiastically
                    <lb/>attached to the country and the Government <lb/>from whence they derived
                    all their blessings, and, <lb/>wherever they were found, would form a barrier
                    <lb/>against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly <lb/>be expected from the
                    generous sympathy which <lb/>the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had every<lb
                        break="no"/>where excited in the United States, and from <lb/>the
                    acknowledged liberality of its Constituted <lb/>Authorities ; but very forcible
                    arguments might <lb/>also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not <lb/>only
                    those that in the ordinary course of events <lb/>would arrive here, whose
                    usefulness is lost by <lb/>the want of proper direction, and who become
                    <lb/>burdens or scourges to our cities, would be res<lb break="no"/>cued and
                    placed in a situation where all the ener<lb break="no"/>gies of active and
                    enterprising minds would be <lb/>serviceable to themselves and the community ;
                    <lb/>but also the very fact that such an asylum was <lb/>open and accessible,
                    would infinitely increase <lb/>the amount of emigration from Ireland, and peo<lb
                        break="no"/>ple our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. <lb/>The place
                    upon which we have fixed our eyes is <lb/>in the Illinois territory&#x2013;it
                    has been lately pur<lb break="no"/>chased, and is not yet even surveyed. In the
                    <lb/>ordinary course of events, it is not likely to be <lb/>brought into market
                    (at least to any extent) for <lb/>many years ; but if Congress listen to our
                        ap<lb break="no"/>plication, and grant to the settlers an extended
                    <lb/>credit, Government will receive payment for the <lb/>land probably as soon
                    as if it were suffered to <lb/>remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale
                    <lb/>came round. A large body of settlers will be <lb/>enabled to grow rich
                    during the time that the <lb/>land would otherwise be waste and unproduc<lb
                        break="no"/>tive, and the value of all the contiguous proper<lb break="no"
                    />ty belonging to the United States would be ra<lb break="no"/>pidly and
                    immensely increased, to say nothing <lb/>of the advantages resulting from the
                    strength of <lb/>such a settled frontier. All these considerations <lb/>may be
                    strongly urged by men, who can most <lb/>truly say they are actuated by no views
                    of <lb/>personal speculation or emolument ; who are <lb/>willing to enter into
                    all the labour of procuring <lb/>settlers and organising the establishment,
                        with<lb break="no"/>out any prospect of gain, or even compensation,
                    <lb/>except as to what may be necessary for defray<lb break="no"/>ing the
                    expences of the undertaking ; and who <lb/>are desirous that the actual settlers
                    should enjoy <lb/>all the advantages which Government may be <lb/>willing to
                    grant.</p>
                <p>These are our views&#x2013;we conceive that they <lb/>may be realized, if
                    supported by an united and <lb/>active co-operation of those who think like us
                    <lb/>in other parts of the Union. We are, therefore, <lb/>desirous of adopting
                    and pointing out to others <lb/>what seems to be the best mode of giving system
                    <lb/>to that co-operation ; namely, the formation of <lb/>societies totally
                    divested of all party or political <lb/>feelings, and directing the attention
                    only to this <lb/>object. There are already a sufficient number <lb/>of
                    political institutions in every State, in which <lb/>the zealous partizan (be
                    his opinions what they <lb/>may) can act on them to their fullest extent.
                    <lb/>Let these societies be neutral groun, or rather <lb/>consecrated places, in
                    which, when we meet, we <lb/>lay aside all our hostilities, and join as brothers
                    <lb/>in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our <lb/>common worship. They
                    are consecrated to <lb/>every man amongst us, by the purity of their
                    <lb/>object, by our earliest recollections, by our un<lb break="no"/>broken
                    affection, and our strongest sympathies&#x2013; <lb/>by the unextinguished love
                    of our native land, <lb/>for which most of us have already renounced all
                    <lb/>sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; <lb/>which we offer as a
                    solemn pledge to the coun<lb break="no"/>try of our adoption, that our hearts
                    will be al<lb break="no"/>ways alive, from temperament as well as prin<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ciple, to the emotions of patriotism ; and that <lb/>those amongst us who
                    have pledged their faith <lb/>to her, however they may seem to differ on some
                    <lb/>minor political subjects, will always be found <lb/>firmly ranged and
                    united under the same ban<lb break="no"/>ners, and forming one phalanx whenever
                    her <lb/>more important interests are concerned.</p>
                <p>Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions, which <lb/>being severally put, were
                    carried with some <lb/>slight amendments as follow :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>1. Resolved&#x2013;That it is expedient to form a Society of <lb/>Irishmen and
                    descendents of Irishmen, for the purpose of en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to
                    procure from Congress a track of land in the <lb/>Illinois territory, to be
                    settled by emigrants from Ireland. <lb/>2. Resolved&#x2013;That every person of
                    the foregoing descrip<lb break="no"/>tion, who shall, on or before the second
                    day of December <lb/>next, pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five
                    <lb/>dollars, shall be entitled to become a Member of the said So<lb break="no"
                    />ciety, until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to <lb/>one
                    hundred, after which time the subscribers shall be at li<lb break="no"/>berty to
                    elect their own officers and no person shall after<lb break="no"/>wards be
                    admitted except by ballot. <lb/>3. Resolved&#x2013;That it be recommended in
                    Irishmen, and <lb/>the descendents of Irishmen, in the other cities and towns of
                    <lb/>the Union, to form similar societies for the purpose of cor<lb break="no"
                    />responding and co-operating with that which is about to be <lb/>formed in this
                    city. <lb/>4. Resolved&#x2013;That, as the meeting of Congress will short<lb
                        break="no"/>ly take place, and in order to prevent the less of time, a
                        Com<lb break="no"/>mittee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of
                    a me<lb break="no"/>morial to that body, to be submitted to the consideration of
                    the <lb/>Society, when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such
                    <lb/>measures as they may think expedient for promoting and ac<lb break="no"
                    />celebrating the organization of that Society.</p>
                <p>Mr John W. Mulligan, in seconding Mr Em<lb break="no"/>met's motion, expressed,
                    in handsome terms, how <lb/>much he was gratified by the invitation to attend,
                    <lb/>had given him the opportunity of claiming <lb/>his title of descendent of
                    an Irishman.</p>
                <p>A Committee was then appointed, pursuant <lb/>to the fourth resolution, the
                    number being, upon <lb/>motion and discussion, augmented to twenty<lb break="no"
                    />one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Committee</hi>&#x2013;Andrew Morris, Thomas Addis
                    <lb/>Emmet, William Sampson, John W. Mulligan, <lb/>Thomas Kirk, James Moffit,
                    Robert Swanton, <lb/>Matthew Carroll, William James M'Neven, Cap<lb break="no"
                    />tain Skiddy, Dennic M'Carthy, John Meyher, <lb/>James M'Bride, Cornelius
                    Heeney, William Pa<lb break="no"/>terson, Colonel Mulaney, David Bryson, Captain
                    <lb/>O'Sullivan, James J. M'Donnell, Dennis H. <lb/>Doyle, James Hayes.</p>
                <p>A subscription paper being then opened, a <lb/>number of those present subscribed
                    their names <lb/>and paid five dollars as their initiation fee, and <lb/>became
                    members of the association. Those per<lb break="no"/>sons who wish to become
                    original members may <lb/>do so by signing their names and paying their
                    <lb/>subscription to the Secretary before 2d De<lb break="no"/>cember, pursuant
                    to the second resolution.</p>
                <p>After the meeting was adjourned, the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee organized itself,
                    and appointed Sub-Com<lb break="no"/>mittees, to report a draft of a
                    constitution and a <lb/>memorial to Congress, and for the discharge of
                    <lb/>other requisite duties.</p>

                <p>"We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in con<lb break="no"
                    />templation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into <lb/>Great Britain
                    and Ireland, from the British North American <lb/>Provinces, equal to the
                    additional duty imposed on Foreign <lb/>Timber in 1813 will be further
                    suspended.</p>
                <p>"Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment
                    of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] <lb/>bring us [?]
                    at a low freight, whereby we are enabled to furnish <lb/>the British West India
                    Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?], <lb/>and that on very moderate terms
                    ; but, in the event of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment persisting in imposing the
                    Duty on Timber from hence, <lb/>that branch of our trade will inevitably revert
                    to the Americans, <lb/>besides being the ruin of many in this and in the

                <p>"The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother <lb/>country, upon trial,
                    will be found delusive ; to prove this, many <lb/>obvious[?] reasons can be
                    adduced : As the trade now exists, all the <lb/>Timber extracted from these
                    Colonies to Great Britain and Ire<lb break="no"/>land is paid for in British
                    Manufactures ; the export of so bulky <lb/>an article as Timber, and the import
                    of so ponderous an article <lb/>as [?], employs[?] an immense number of British
                    ships ; objects <lb/>certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than
                    any <lb/>benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on
                    <lb/>the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be <lb/>denied
                    that previous to 1813, when the additional Duty was laid <lb/>on Foreign Timber,
                    they (the Foreigners) were not only the <lb/>carriers, but would not accept an
                    ounce of British Manufac<lb break="no"/>ture in payment for their
                    TImber&#x2013;no, nothing but you gold[?] <lb/>which was so much in demand, that
                    28s. was given for a [?]. <lb/>Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in
                    favour of what <lb/>is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these
                        Provin<lb break="no"/>ces ; it facilitates emigration, and introduces many
                    valuable set<lb break="no"/>tlers into this Province, and the Canadas, that
                    would go to the <lb/>States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far
                    distant when <lb/>they would of accessity[?] become our enemies.</p>
                <p>"When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eas<lb break="no"/>tern
                    countries, from whence the principal supply of Timber was <lb/>derived, the
                    merchants in that line[?], as well as the ship-masters <lb/>were not only
                    alarmed, but convinced themselves ruined ! The <lb/>Baltic is shut[?], what
                    shall we do for Timber, and with our ships? <lb/>They properly concluded that
                    perhaps the British Provinces could <lb/>supply them ; they made the experiment,
                    they were not disap<lb break="no"/>pointed&#x2013;but succeeded far beyond their
                    expectations. If there<lb break="no"/>fore, in time of war, Britain has took to
                    her colonies for a sup<lb break="no"/>ply of such a necessary article as Wood ;
                    it is not reasonable for <lb/>us to conclude that their interests will not be
                    wholly neglected, <lb/>when blessed with peace."</p>

                <p>"In the Southern States, this autumn has been the most fa<lb break="no"/>tal they

                <p>Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft <lb/>of a petition to the Prince
                    Regent, founded on <lb/>the resolutions adopted in the province of Nia<lb
                        break="no"/>gara, where some discontent has been manifested. <lb/>The first
                    part is as follows:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales, Regent <lb/>of the United Kingdom
                    of Great Britain and Ireland, <lb/>&amp;c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants
                    of Upper <lb/>Canada</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">May it please your Royal Highness,</hi>
                </p>
                <p>"The subjects of your Royal Father, dwelling in Upper <lb/>Canada, should need no
                    words to give assurance of their <lb/>loyalty, if the whole truth had reached
                    the throne of their <lb/>Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the
                    truth <lb/>has not been told.</p>
                <p>During three years of war, Upper Canada was exposed <lb/>to the ravages of a
                    powerful and inveterate foe. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment of the United States
                    had been long concerting the <lb/>invasion of this province. Hostile
                    preparations against it had <lb/>been long masked under other designs ; and at
                    last the ac<lb break="no"/>cumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless
                        chil<lb break="no"/>dren of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by
                    the <lb/>weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded <lb/>those
                    host of the enemy, forgetful of honour, regardless of hu<lb break="no"/>manity,
                    and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from <lb/>their true allegiance.
                    The subjects of Britain remained <lb/>dauntless and firm. It was not for their
                    property that they <lb/>rose against their invaders ; the invader would have
                    spared to <lb/>them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the
                    <lb/>rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American <lb/>standard
                    been planted in Upper Canada, while yet but a hand<lb break="no"/>ful of British
                    troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of <lb/>victory over the
                    protrate intruders on their soil. The se<lb break="no"/>cond year of war saw
                    Canada contending with yet little as<lb break="no"/>sistance from the parent
                    state. The second year of the war <lb/>saw her sons confirmed in their virtue,
                    and still more deter<lb break="no"/>mined to resist. Wives and children had fled
                    from their <lb/>homes ; the face of the country was laid waste, and the fire of
                    <lb/>revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; <lb/>still was
                    the spirit of the people unextinguished, still did it <lb/>burn with patriotism
                    and loyalty.</p>
                <p>"By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end, for <lb/>now the British
                    aid poured into the provinces, and peace <lb/>was proclaimed when war was no
                    longer to be feared.</p>
                <p>"It is now more than three years since there was an end <lb/>of war, but, strange
                    to say, these years of peace have ma<lb break="no"/>nifested no appearance of
                    affection or care from the mother <lb/>country to the Canadas. Commercial
                    treaties have been <lb/>made, altogether neglectful of British interests here.
                        Go<lb break="no"/>vernment transactions, which used to give spirit to trade
                    and <lb/>are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications <lb/>are suffered
                    to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too <lb/>shocking to be repeated in the
                    Royal ear. May it please <lb/>your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the
                    complains and <lb/>grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully
                    <lb/>assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of <lb/>most
                    important truths ; who are well assured of the gene<lb break="no"/>rous
                    disposition of your Royal heart, and of your desire that <lb/>British subjects
                    should every where share equally you pater<lb break="no"/>nal regard an
                    affection.</p>
                <p>"It was a matter of much provocation to the people of <lb/>the province to see,
                    even during the war, which afforded <lb/>such striking proofs of their loyalty
                    and valour, reports <lb/>went home highly rating the merits of regular troops,
                    <lb/>while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set <lb/>down, may,
                    the principles of the most loyal subjects here <lb/>were often stigmatised by
                    British officers, ignorant of <lb/>human character, and still more so of
                    circumstances <lb/>which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so
                    <lb/>with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Cana<lb break="no"/>dian
                    worth, and his memory will happily long cherish, in <lb/>the minds of the
                    Canadian people, a due regard for the <lb/>genuine spirit of a British solider,
                    at once generous and <lb/>brave.</p>
                <p>"The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain <lb/>to notice the
                    misrepresentations of individuals, so contrary <lb/>to notorious truth, if these
                    had not obviously conspired with <lb/>other causes to lessen the regard which
                    should subsist be<lb break="no"/>tween British subjects here and at home, to
                    influence the <lb/>conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the
                        pro<lb break="no"/>vince.</p>
                <p>"The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada <lb/>suffered grievously
                    during the war in their property, and <lb/>many were bereft of their all. A
                    solemn investigation on <lb/>this subject took place ; the claims of the
                    sufferers were au<lb break="no"/>thenticated, and there was every reason to
                    expect that re<lb break="no"/>compence would immediately follow ; yet nothing
                    has fol<lb break="no"/>lowed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among
                    mankind <lb/>a single principle of justice, that is one, that the individuals
                    <lb/>of a nation ought not, partially, to bear the weight of public
                    <lb/>calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives <lb/>for
                    Government should not be disgusted with finding Go<lb break="no"/>vernment
                    regardless of those very principles which it is in<lb break="no"/>tended to
                    sustain. The people of this province are well <lb/>aware that their fellow
                    subjects at home are pressed hard <lb/>with taxations, and far it is from their
                    wish that relief <lb/>should be afford from thence. Canada contains within it<lb
                        break="no"/>self ample means of exonerating Government from the <lb/>claims
                    of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your <lb/>Royal Highness
                    to remove, by a signle breath, the evil now <lb/>justly complained of. Millions
                    of acres of fertile lands lie <lb/>here at the disposal of your Royal Highness,
                    upon the credit <lb/>of which, under proper management, not only the fair claims
                    <lb/>of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced, but vast sums <lb/>could be
                    raised for the improvement of the provinces, and <lb/>the increase of revenue to
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>"Another grievance, manifesting the neglect of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to the
                    concerns of Upper Canada, is equally notorious, <lb/>and must be still more
                    abhorrent to the general feelings of <lb/>your Royal Highness.</p>
                <p>"The young men of this province, who were armed in <lb/>its defence had, for
                    their spirited conduct, the promise of <lb/>their commanders, that land would be
                    granted them as a <lb/>reward for their services, as soon as war was terminated
                    ; <lb/>and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parlia<lb
                        break="no"/>ment of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law, in the face
                    <lb/>of established British principles, that militia should pass <lb/>beyond the
                    frontier. With these promises, and in obedience <lb/>to this law, the militia
                    passed beyond the frontier with <lb/>alacrity ; yet since the peace, the greater
                    part of them had <lb/>been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services,
                    and <lb/>the land is unjudtly withheld."</p>
                <p>The petition further states that such ingratitude, <lb/>such dishonour, such
                    errors in policy, could not <lb/>exist without extraordinary influences, and it
                    <lb/>recommends most important changes equally for <lb/>the glory of the throne,
                    and benefit of the <lb/>subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came
                    <lb/>some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous in<lb break="no"/>gratitude,
                    the the home Ministers wisely im<lb break="no"/>posed restriction on the Land
                    Council of Upper <lb/>Canada. It seems, however, that all this was
                    <lb/>insufficient, and that confusion on confusion has <lb/>grown out of this
                    unhappy system. Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, it is now said, pines in
                    comparative de<lb break="no"/>cay, and that discontent and poverty are expe<lb
                        break="no"/>rienced in a land supremely blessed with the <lb/>gifts of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>It is insisted that the immediate interfe<lb break="no"/>rence of his Royal
                    Highness might do <lb/>much to remove the evils which spring from the
                    <lb/>system of patronage and favouritism, and it as<lb break="no"/>serts that
                    the interposition of the British Par<lb break="no"/>liament is more imperiously
                    required. It con<lb break="no"/>cludes as follows:&#x2013;" Deeply penetrated
                    with <lb/>these sentiments, and most seriously inclined to <lb/>have changes
                    speedily effected, the loyal <lb/>subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper
                    <lb/>Canada now take the extraordinary step of send<lb break="no"/>ing home
                    Commissioners to bear this to the <lb/>throne, and humbly intreat your Royal
                        High<lb break="no"/>ness to give ear to the details which it will be in
                    <lb/>their power to relate: above all, that your Royal <lb/>Highness would
                    immediately send out to this <lb/>province a commission, consisting of
                    discreet</p>
                <p><pb/>and wise men, men of business and talent, who <lb/>shall be above every
                    influence here, and who <lb/>may be instructed to make inquiry into all the

                <p>"The seizure, trial, and execution of two <lb/>men, said to be British subjects,
                    by our military <lb/>folks, who lately invaded, the Spanish Territory,
                    <lb/>seems to be confirmed by accounts from the <lb/>south, with a lament added
                    thereto, that another <lb/>of the same nation had not been catched and
                    <lb/>killed. If these accounts should prove true, I <lb/>think the President
                    will as good reason for <lb/>recommending to Congress, at the next session,
                    <lb/>the abolition of the army, as he had at the last, <lb/>for doing away the
                    naval forces on the lakes&#x2013; <lb/>because it was more likely to involve us
                    in war, <lb/>than to give us security and peace. A little <lb/>while ago we made
                    quite a bluster and noise be<lb break="no"/>cause the King of Spain had
                    imprisoned one of <lb/>our citizens at Cadiz; but the nation seems to <lb/>rest
                    very easy at present with the above named <lb/>executions. Why?&#x2013;because
                    the wrong is com<lb break="no"/>mitted by us, not against us."</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated Washington city, <lb/>June 2. 1818:&#x2013;" The
                    British Consul-General, <lb/>A. St. John Baker, is about to depart for Eu<lb
                        break="no"/>rope; the ostensible cause of his departure is the <lb/>recovery
                    of his health, but it is sufficient to look <lb/>in his face to see that it is
                    only a common diplo<lb break="no"/>matic disease, which may be aggravated or
                    cured <lb/>at discretion ; the real object is diplomatic ; the <lb/>English
                    Cabinet has expressed some hesitation <lb/>in regard to certain subjects in Mr
                    Bagot's dis<lb break="no"/>patches ; the speculation carrying on between the
                    <lb/>Spanish agents and some persons in this place <lb/>opens a field of
                    corruption so wide and compre<lb break="no"/>hensive. Mr Baker goes prepared to
                    state the facts, <lb/>from his immediate knowledge ; for no man is <lb/>better
                    acquainted with men and things here.&#x2013; <lb/>The Chevalier Colonel
                    Sarmiento is also prepar<lb break="no"/>ing to visit Madrid, but his business
                    appears to <lb/>relate to mercantile affairs of some Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans
                    on the west coast ; he received 27,000 dol<lb break="no"/>lars for one service
                    of this king, but the object <lb/>for which he received the douceur failed, and
                    he <lb/>will not refund."</p>

                <p>Washington, May 25, 1818. <lb/>SIR&#x2013;The act of Congress, "concerning
                    navigation," hereto <lb/>annexed, which is to take effect the first day of
                    October <lb/>next, so materially changes the commerce of the United <lb/>States
                    with the colonies and territories of Britannic Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty, thata
                    due regard to the convenience and interest of <lb/>those engaged in it requires
                    that the construction of the act <lb/>should at this time be determined.</p>
                <p>According to the term used un ther the first section of the <lb/>act, every port
                    or place in the British colonies and territories <lb/>in the West Indies, and on
                    the continent of America, must <lb/>be considered as closed against vessels of
                    the United States, <lb/>to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to
                    carry <lb/>on the same trade, both in exports and imports, which is <lb/>now, or
                    shall be, carried on in British vessels between the <lb/>ports of the United
                    States and the ports of any British colony <lb/>or territory.</p>
                <p>The permissions by act of Parliament to vessels of the <lb/>United States to go
                    in ballast to Turk's Island, and bring <lb/>away salt, or to carry certain
                    articles to one or more of the <lb/>Bahama Islands, and bring away salt, and a
                    few other ar<lb break="no"/>ticles, cannot be considered as opening the ports of
                    those <lb/>islands to the vessels of the United States, according to the
                    <lb/>intention of the act of Congress, whilst British vessels are <lb/>permitted
                    to carry on the same trade in articles prohibited to <lb/>vessels of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>It may be proper to observe, that the prohibition in the <lb/>first section
                    applies equally to vessels whether in ballast or <lb/>with cargoes.</p>
                <p>The form of the bond required by the second section of <lb/>the act is hereunto
                    annexed. It is expected that proper cir<lb break="no"/>cumspection will be
                    exercised in requiring a security, as much <lb/>of the efficacy of the act will
                    depend upon the judicious dis<lb break="no"/>charge of this part of your
                    duty.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Our paper of Thursday last contained a gene<lb break="no"/>ral view of some of
                    the most popular publications <lb/>on the subject of emigration, and we shall
                    now <lb/>endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the <lb/>good and evil which
                    is likely to befal those who <lb/>embark in this hazardous adventure.</p>
                <p>There is one important fact which we gather <lb/>from all the accounts of
                    America, whether writ<lb break="no"/>ten for the purpose of praise or censure,
                    namely, <lb/>that there is a great demand for labour, and that <lb/>wages are
                    high, and this effect is necessarily <lb/>produced y the vast space of fertile
                    and unoc<lb break="no"/>cupied territory which lies westward of the <lb/>United
                    States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is <lb/>this vacant territory which is the
                    true spring of <lb/>this American community. Here is the grand out<lb break="no"
                    />let for the superflouous population both of the east<lb break="no"/>ern states
                    of America and of Europe. To cultivate <lb/>this waste there is a constant
                    demand for new la<lb break="no"/>bourers ; wages are, of course, high &#x2013;
                    the labourer <lb/>lives in comfort, and, if he is industrious, he be<lb
                        break="no"/>comes in his turn a purchaser of land from the sa<lb break="no"
                    />vings which he accumulates. If labour should be<lb break="no"/>come more
                    plentiful, and wages should fall, this is <lb/>the signal for new emigrations ;
                    and thus, this con<lb break="no"/>stant demand for labour in the western
                    districts <lb/>regulates its general price throughout the United <lb/>States. In
                    these circumstrances it is clear that <lb/>a labourer, provided he can reach
                    this advan<lb break="no"/>tageous market for his labour, will unquestionably
                    <lb/>improve his condition. But herein lies the dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty. A
                    labourer has seldon the means of <lb/>of subsitence so far beforehand as to
                    enable him to <lb/>undertake so long a journey ; and, if he enters <lb/>upon the
                    enterprise with insufficient means, he <lb/>is liable to starve before he can
                    transport him<lb break="no"/>self to his ultimate destination, or he is forced
                    to <lb/>contract, for immediate subsistence, obligations <lb/>little short of
                    servitude, under the weight of <lb/>which he is grievously oppressed. These,
                    then <lb/>form strong objections to emigrations in the case <lb/>of those who
                    are stinted to their means ; but <lb/>where these objections can be surmounted,
                    those <lb/>who can transport their labour from the over<lb break="no"/>stocked
                    market of Europe to the understocked <lb/>market of America, will unquestionably
                    dispose <lb/>of it to better advantage ; but if they have not <lb/>the means,
                    they may as furely fail in the at<lb break="no"/>tempt, and draw upon themselves
                    aggravated mi<lb break="no"/>sery and want. As to the consequences of emi<lb
                        break="no"/>gration to this country, we hold them rather to be
                    <lb/>beneficial than otherwise, and we cannot easily ac<lb break="no"/>count for
                    the very absurd alarm which has been <lb/>propagated on this subject. The evil
                    in Europe is, <lb/>that every country is overcrowded with labourers, <lb/>who
                    cannot find employment ; and is it not mani<lb break="no"/>fest, therefore, that
                    the withdrawing of some of <lb/>these will make more room for the labourers that
                    <lb/>remain &#x2013; that the loss of those useless hands <lb/>will rather be a
                    relief to the body politic, and <lb/>will diffuse greater soundness and vigour
                    through <lb/>all its parts? That these effects will follow from <lb/>emigration
                    in this or in any other country in <lb/>Europe we cannot doubt &#x2013; and that
                    the labourer, <lb/>if he can afford the expence of the jounrye, will re<lb
                        break="no"/>ceive higher wages in America than in this coun<lb break="no"
                    />try, is equally clear.</p>
                <p>There is another class of adventurers who <lb/>may possibly improve their
                    circumstances by <lb/>emigration, although this is not so certain, name<lb
                        break="no"/>ly, farmers with a moderate capital. An allot<lb break="no"
                    />ment of land may be purchased in the back parts <lb/>of America at the
                    Government price of two dol<lb break="no"/>lars per acre, and an emigrant who
                    can afford to <lb/>but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres, and <lb/>acts with
                    proper judgement and skill, may <lb/>undoubtedly, by a speculation of this sort,
                    be sure <lb/>of a subsistence, while, by the continued emigra<lb break="no"
                    />tions from the eastern states, the country being <lb/>quickly settled all
                    around him, his property is <lb/>daily improving in value. But a want of
                    judgement <lb/>in the purchase, or a want of ability to cultivate the <lb/>land
                    after it is purchased, may involve him in ir<lb break="no"/>recoverable distress
                    and ruin ; and to avoid these <lb/>hazards no little discrimination and prudence
                    is <lb/>necessary.</p>
                <p>Such are some of the most striking advantages <lb/>of emigration, and we shall
                    now state some of <lb/>its disadvantages. The first, and chief of these, <lb/>is
                    the difficulty of effecting a settlement, and of <lb/>subsisting until the land
                    which is purchased yields <lb/>its first produce. The country is partly open
                    <lb/>ground, or prairie, as it is called, or it is co<lb break="no"/>vered with
                    almost boundless forests. A settle<lb break="no"/>ment in the woods requires
                    incredible labour to <lb/>clear it &#x2013; labour is dear, and not easily
                    procured, <lb/>and this herculean task naturally devolves on the <lb/>head of
                    the family, who is forced during the day <lb/>to ply the axe in this laborious
                    drudgery of fell<lb break="no"/>ing trees, and afterwards to follow the chace
                    for <lb/>a meal to his family. Here he must frequently <lb/>sleep out in the
                    woods ; and his body, exhausted <lb/>with his day's labour, is exposed to the
                    cold <lb/>dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his <lb/>health
                    declines, and it is obvious that his family, <lb/>deprived even for a single day
                    of his exertions, <lb/>must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. <lb/>In
                    many parts the country which is marked out <lb/>for emigrants is extremely
                    unhealthy, in particu<lb break="no"/>lar the banks of all the navigable rivers,
                    which <lb/>afford the most eligible settlements both in point <lb/>of fertility
                    and situation, are exposed to the most <lb/>fatal maladies. The same causes
                    which produce <lb/>fertility produce disease. The overflowing of <lb/>the
                    waters, from the autumnal and spring floods, <lb/>fertilise the land in a most
                    wonderful degree ; <lb/>but the exhalations of these stagnant waters, un<lb
                        break="no"/>der a burning sun, are as fatal to the health as <lb/>the
                    deposits which they leave are favourable to <lb/>the soil. Hence the many minute
                    directions <lb/>which are given to all emigrants in regard to <lb/>their health.
                    In a letter contained in the Emi<lb break="no"/>grant's Guide, we have the
                    following advice to <lb/>those who are descending the Ohio : " If the
                    <lb/>weather becomes warm, guard well against the <lb/>smell of bilge water. But
                    if you must descend in <lb/>the spring, go early &#x2013; avoid all delay, and
                        remem<lb break="no"/>ber you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the
                    <lb/>havoc, and I believed it not till then." Again it <lb/>is observed, " Let
                    nothing tempt you to fish in <lb/>warm weather, immediately on changing your
                    <lb/>climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison." <lb/>To a European emigran
                    the climate must be, of <lb/>course, even more fatal ; and he either therefore
                    <lb/>lose his health, or he must be continually <lb/>tormented with anxiously
                    taking care of it, which <lb/>makes it a question whether it is worth having on
                    <lb/>such terms. Such are the hardships through which, <lb/>if he has strength
                    to endure them, he at length <lb/>emerges into ease and independence. These
                        hard<lb break="no"/>ships, however, will no doubt be in a great mea<lb
                        break="no"/>sure avoided, or at least mitigated, if he has be<lb break="no"
                    />forehand provided the means of subsistence until <lb/>he can derive regular
                    supplies from his own <lb/>land. In this case he is less laible to be
                    <lb/>dislodged from his situation by the casualties to <lb/>which all emigrants
                    are necessarily exposed. &#x2013; <lb/>He is secured against the hardships of a
                    first <lb/>settlement, and is more certain of attaining <cb/>
                    <lb/>the wished for object of ease and affluence &#x2013; <lb/>To a farmer,
                    therefore, or a labourer, emigra<lb break="no"/>tion presents a fair chance of a
                    permanent settle<lb break="no"/>ment, provided it is gone about with ordinary
                    <lb/>caution, and the necessary degree of energy be <lb/>exerted to insure
                    success. But it is a gross de<lb break="no"/>lusion to imagine that an elysium
                    is to be found in <lb/>the United States, or that mankind exist there on
                    <lb/>any more favourable terms than in this country, <lb/>and those who set out
                    on any such visionary <lb/>schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappoint<lb
                        break="no"/>ment. With regard to other classes of society, it <lb/>does not
                    appear that they will improve their con<lb break="no"/>dition by emigration to
                    America ; there is no de<lb break="no"/>mand for clerks or professional men of
                    any sort, <lb/>and no merchant has any thing to expect by remo<lb break="no"
                    />ving his capital to the United States. In the back <lb/>settlements there is a
                    demand for schoolmasters <lb/>to teach the ordinary branches of education, and
                    <lb/>several emigrants of this class have met with <lb/>good encouragement.</p>
                <p>In regard to the essential article of comfort, it <lb/>is apparent, from all the
                    best information on the <lb/>subject, that a person long resident in this
                        coun<lb break="no"/>try would change for the worse by an emigra<lb
                        break="no"/>tion to the United States. He would, in the <lb/>first place,
                    suffer extremely from the climate, from <lb/>the extreme cold of winter and the
                    raging heat <lb/>of summer, the thermometer frequently standing <lb/>at 98
                    degrees in the share, with a clear sky and <lb/>broiling sun, and very little
                    abatement of this ex<lb break="no"/>sessive heat being experienced through the
                    night. <lb/>His frame, accustomed to the more temperate, <lb/>though unsettled
                    climate of this country, <lb/>runs the risk of being debilitated by the change,
                    <lb/>and at all events he must suffer extremely in <lb/>his enjoyments and in
                    his spirit from this <lb/>cause. Nor, we should imagine, would the man<lb
                        break="no"/>ners of the people in the back parts be found <lb/>very
                    agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all <lb/>hands, both by those who are
                    favourable and <lb/>those who are unfavourable to the Americans, <lb/>that if
                    there is not, as in Europe, gross igno<lb break="no"/>rance and debasement on
                    the one hand, neither <lb/>is there on the other any thing much exalted
                    <lb/>above the ordinary level. But the inferences <lb/>which arise from this
                    established fact are strongly <lb/>in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice
                    and <lb/>ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corrup<lb break="no"/>tions in
                    the disgust which it excites : such <lb/>examples are not so potent to debase,
                    as ex<lb break="no"/>amples of a different sort are to purify and <lb/>exalt.
                    There is little risk that society will <lb/>be contaminated by what is low and
                        deba<lb break="no"/>sed ; but on the other hand, there is a cer<lb
                        break="no"/>tainty that what is exalted and illustrious in li<lb break="no"
                    />terature, science, taste, accomplishments, or <lb/>fashion, will exercise a
                    powerful influence on <lb/>the general state of manners. We naturally <lb/>copy
                    what we admire, and those great and shin<lb break="no"/>ing examples constitute
                    a standard to which <lb/>the whole system of life and manners has a <lb/>tacit
                    reference. In the United States they have <lb/>no such models &#x2013; they do
                    not aim at so high a <lb/>standard, and taste and manners are therefore
                    <lb/>necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe &#x2013; <lb/>Hence all accounts
                    agree in reprobating the ex<lb break="no"/>treme filthy habits which universally
                    prevail ; and <lb/>Cobbett, who will be suspected of too great <lb/>partiality
                    to this country, draws a contrast be<lb break="no"/>tween the inhabitants of
                    Hampshire and those of <lb/>the United States, in which he places this vice
                    <lb/>of the American manners in strong colours ; and <lb/>he adds, as his reason
                    for this, that they have <lb/>no gentlemen's seats, with the fine improvements
                    <lb/>of pleasure grounds, &amp;c. dispersed through the <lb/>country, as models
                    of taste and neatness for the <lb/>inferior classes, and it is to the same
                    principles that <lb/>we may trace other defects in their manners, <lb/>namely,
                    that they have no proper models on which <lb/>to form themselves. Hence,
                    excepting in the <lb/>principal cities, we may safely conclude, from all
                    <lb/>the information we have received on the subject, <lb/>that society has not
                    reach the same degree of <lb/>refinement as in this country.</p>
                <p>An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain <lb/>would also feel the disavantages
                    of Ameri<lb break="no"/>can society strong in this, that here, in so
                    <lb/>closely peopled a community, surrounded with <lb/>all sorts of refinements,
                    life is assisted by such <lb/>a variety of helps, that it glides down the
                    <lb/>smooth stream of comfort and convenience, with<lb break="no"/>out ever
                    meeting with a single interruption. It <lb/>is astonishing to what a pitch of
                    improvement a <lb/>society is brough, abounding in wealth and in all <lb/>the
                    mechanical arts, and where the ingenuity of <lb/>thousands is incessantly on the
                    rack to set on <lb/>foot new devices for the common good. We <lb/>are not duly
                    sensible of the advantages of this, <lb/>because, like other advantages, they
                    are familiar <lb/>to us by long habit, and we begin to imagine <lb/>that they
                    are inherent in the natural constitution <lb/>of things. But when we are
                    suddenly trans<lb break="no"/>planted into a new community, abounding in<lb
                        break="no"/>deed in subsistence, but deficient in all com<lb break="no"
                    />forts &#x2013; where only the coarsest mechanic arts are <lb/>practised
                    &#x2013; where the inhabitants are so wide<lb break="no"/>ly dispersed, that
                    their common exertions <lb/>cannot be made available for the common <lb/>good,
                    we find life interrupted at every turn. In <lb/>our former society, if we had
                    not the previous <lb/>secret of transmuting all things into gold, we <lb/>had at
                    least the power of transmuting gold into <lb/>every thing else. But here the
                    power of money <lb/>is limited. We must indeed pay for services, <lb/>but we
                    must also beg for them ; and thus we go <lb/>on fretting and tormenting
                    ourselves under petty <lb/>incommodities, which in this country would be
                    <lb/>remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ceivable how much inconvenience and discom<lb break="no"/>fort and real
                    unhappiness may spring from this <lb/>cause. In this country, by long habit and
                        prac<lb break="no"/>rice and continual improvement, every thing has
                    <lb/>fallen into its right place &#x2013; each individual has a <lb/>separate
                    task assigned him in the joint task of <lb/>labouring for the general benefit
                    &#x2013; and the in<lb break="no"/>dustry of all, however variously directed,
                    tends <lb/>to one common end. There is a perfect unity <lb/>of effort. We all
                    labour in common &#x2013; we com<lb break="no"/>bine our efforts that they may
                    yield the largest <lb/>possible produce, and this produce is accurately
                    <lb/>shared among the various members of the com<lb break="no"/>munity, each
                    receiving the share to which his <lb/>labour entitles him. Such is substantially
                    the <lb/>process by which commerce diffuses the benefits <lb/>of industry over
                    every civilized community. &#x2013; <lb/>Money is the instrument by which this
                    division <lb/>is effected. Every one who labours has the value <lb/>of his
                    labour ascertained in money, which is a <lb/>draft upon the common stock for
                    whatever quan<lb break="no"/>tity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to
                    ; <lb/>and all these complicated operations are execut<lb break="no"/>ed with a
                    regularity almost mechanical. But in <lb/>a community newly forming there is a
                    want of <lb/>unity and combination &#x2013; all the members labour <lb/>indeed,
                    but no one has his proper part assigned <lb/>him &#x2013; there is a jostling
                    and an interference with <lb/>each other &#x2013; and when they come to divide,
                    <lb/>some have too much, and some too little, of cer<lb break="no"/>tain
                    articles &#x2013; the stock is ill assorted, and money <cb/>
                    <lb/>will not execute its functions. Hence disorder <lb/>arises, and inconvience
                    and awkward wants, <lb/>and an individual suddenly removed into this <lb/>region
                    of discomfort from the happier climate of <lb/>a highly improved community, must
                    be annoy<lb break="no"/>ed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy <lb/>and
                    disagreeable. He must have the same sen<lb break="no"/>sation as a person who
                    quits an elegant mansion, <lb/>fitted up with every comfort and convenience,
                    <lb/>for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished, <lb/>where he is exposed
                    to a thousand annoyances <lb/>every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson,
                    <lb/>that the evil of life does not consist in any sud<lb break="no"/>den and
                    overwhelming crash of misery, but in a <lb/>series of petty discomforts amd
                    mischiefs conti<lb break="no"/>nually preying upon the temper. The truth of
                    <lb/>this maxim, those who emigrate from this coun<lb break="no"/>try to the
                    back woods of America, will have a <lb/>good opportunity of verifying.</p>
                <p>The prevalence of slavery in most of the States <lb/>of the Union constitutes
                    another capital defect <lb/>in the structure of American society. These
                    <lb/>slaves form a degraded and oppressed class, and, <lb/>in the tyranny
                    exercised over them, they them<lb break="no"/>selves are morally destroyed,
                    while the corruption <lb/>extends to the other orders of society, equally
                    <lb/>infecting the oppressed and the oppressor, and <lb/>debasing the general
                    character and habits of the <lb/>people. It is vain to talk of liberty while
                    <lb/>stain of tyranny so deeply infects the do<lb break="no"/>mestic manners of
                    a community. There can <lb/>be no rational liberty unless we call that
                    <lb/>liberty which gives us the privilge of tortu<lb break="no"/>ring and
                    oppressing our fellow creatures. To <lb/>give an idea of the consequences of
                    this dread<lb break="no"/>ful evil of slavery, we may state, that it is a
                    <lb/>practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves <lb/>into the hands of the
                    public executioner, by <lb/>whom they are unmercifully flogged at the mar<lb
                        break="no"/>key cross of the different towns, the streets <lb/>being filled
                    with their pietous cries. What <lb/>can we think of the people where such
                        spec<lb break="no"/>tacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so
                    <lb/>utterly revolting to every just and enlightened <lb/>feeling, that to a
                    European it would form a strong <lb/>objection to his permanent residence in
                    that <lb/>country. In all the northern states, and in some <lb/>of the new
                    states, particularly that of the <lb/>Ohio, slavery is indeed abolished. But in
                        se<lb break="no"/>veral others the black form a large proportion <lb/>of the
                    population, and they are not decreasing. <lb/>We know indeed that this evil is
                    admitted in <lb/>its full extent by all the American statesmen, <lb/>that they
                    lament it, but do not well see what <lb/>measures can be adopted to check it.
                    The im<lb break="no"/>portation of new slaves is indeed prohibited, but <lb/>the
                    increase of those already in the country <lb/>is the great grievance, against
                    which it is <lb/>difficult to devise a remedy, and the cruel and <lb/>oppressive
                    treatment which slaves will always <lb/>meet with wherever they exist, must tend
                    <lb/>to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the <lb/>community at large. To
                    such, therefore, as are <lb/>accustomed to European society, where no such
                    <lb/>strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners, <lb/>an exchange into a
                    community where his feel<lb break="no"/>ings may be revolted by spectacles of
                    gross cruel<lb break="no"/>ty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more
                    <lb/>imperious considerations permit, they have cer<lb break="no"/>tainly a
                    greater chance for happiness by remain<lb break="no"/>ing where the rights of
                    nature are respected, than <lb/>by removing to a society where every principle
                    <lb/>of humanity is trampled upon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SIR&#x2013;It will be remember by many of your Readers, that, in the spring of
                    1815, proclamations were widely circulated, inviting settlers to
                    Canada.&#x2013;Having myself occasion <lb/>to visit this country, I was curious
                    to know what had been the result, especially as I found at Quebec and Montreal
                    very discordant accounts respecting it ; most people asserting <lb/>that the
                    scheme had failed of succcess, and that the settlers were in a state of great
                    discomfort and discontent.&#x2013;To ascertain the truth, I diverged from my
                    route about 50 miles, and <lb/>spent some days at Perth, situated on the waters
                    of the Redeau, to which a considerable body of the people who accepted the
                    invitation of the Government had been conducted.&#x2013; <lb/>Here it traced the
                    reported discontent to some neglect in the general management, and some ill
                    conceieved petty regulations, capriciously exercised towards people tenacious of
                    their rights ; <lb/>but in the main, universal satisfaction prevailed among the
                    settlers, and a strong feeling of the good intentions of Government towards
                    them. The opportunity being a good one of ascer<lb break="no"/>taining the
                    progress which a promiscious body of settlers make in a given time. I
                    constructed the annexed table, and had each man's signature attached, at once to
                    prove to correctness <lb/>of his statement, and satisfaction with his situation.
                    Should you think this worthy of publication, you are welcome to publish it in
                    your paper. It may draw attention of a most important <lb/>subject&#x2013;the
                    colonization of this province with British subjects ; and it may afford
                    satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of
                    their friends. The <lb/>scheme which Government adopted in 1815 was expensive.
                    The settlers had a free passage, rations and tools. Next year rations and tools
                    were furnished to those who came out ; <lb/>and this year multitudes of poor
                    people have come to Canada, in expectation of being favoured in the same way,
                    but are disappointed ; having nothing given them but land (100 acres <lb/>each),
                    which many of them from poverty are unable to occupy. Having made it my study,
                    during thrre months residence here, to inquire into the nature of the country,
                    and into every <lb/>particular respecting settlement, I am convinced that very
                    simple measures might be adopted, by which the redundant population of Britain
                    could be conveyed by a regular flow into <lb/>Canada, instead of being wasted,
                    as it now is, to the great prejudice of British interest, over the whole of
                    American ; and were such measures adopted, this province would, in a very
                    <lb/>few years, be quite equal to its defence in war against the United States

                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Convicts destined for Botany Bay.</hi>&#x2013;It is now
                    seven <lb/>weeks since the ten Derby convicts were sent off with several
                    <lb/>others, whose destination for the rest of their lives is Botany <lb/>Bay.
                    They were, upon landing at Sheerness from the Retri<lb break="no"/>bution, put
                    on board the Tottenham, which was engaged to <lb/>land them at their place of
                    punishment. The number on <lb/>board that ship, on leaving Sheerness, was
                    between 2 to 300, <lb/>many of whom were diseased and infirm. Their condition
                    has <lb/>been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay <lb/>that
                    has taken place. The ship Tottenham had not proceed<lb break="no"/>ed farther
                    than the Downs when she lost her rudder, by some <lb/>accident or other. She
                    returned to Sheerness, where she now <lb/>lies, and where she is likely to lie
                    for some time, upon the pre<lb break="no"/>tence that the loss she has sustained
                    is a justification for delay, <lb/>however protracted. The unfortunate inmates
                    have been led <lb/>to expect that some important mitigation of their sentence
                    has <lb/>taken place ;&#x2013;so that between the suspense, and the terrible
                    <lb/>species of confinement to which they are subject, their suffer<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ings are hardto be described.&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">Observer.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Hon. Lieut.-Colonel Erskine.</hi>&#x2013;It is with the
                        great<lb break="no"/>est concern we have to mentioned the death of
                    Lieut.-Colonel <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Erskine,</hi> Lord <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Erskine's</hi> youngest son, on his passage to <lb/>Ceylon. He served
                    throughout the campaigns in Spain as <lb/>a Captain of Light Infantry in the
                    51st regiment, and be<lb break="no"/>haved with great gallantry in the battle of
                    the Pyrenees, <lb/>where being shot in the thigh he was sent home by the Medi<lb
                        break="no"/>cal Board, and on his recovery was placed by the Duke of
                        <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">York</hi> on the Staff of the Army in the
                    Adjutant-General's <lb/>Department when the Duke of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Wellington</hi> took the com<lb break="no"/>mand in Flanders. He was in the
                    battle of the 16th of June, <lb/>and afterwards on the 18th at the battle of
                    Waterloo, where <lb/>his station placed him in the dangerous position of being
                        at<lb break="no"/>tendant on the Duke, around whom almost every officer was
                    <lb/>either killed or wounded. Amongst the rest this brave young <lb/>man had
                    his left arm carried off by a cannon-ball, which pass<lb break="no"/>ing along
                    the other laid bare the whole of it, by which he lost <lb/>the use of two of his
                    fingers, but that arm was saved. When <lb/>the cannon-shot had thrown him from
                    his horse, and as he lay <lb/>bleeding upon the groun in this mangled condition,
                    the Prus<lb break="no"/>sian musketry and trumpets being heard at a distance, he
                        sei<lb break="no"/>zed his hat with his remaining shattered arm. and waving
                    it <lb/>round him cheered his companions in the midst of the dying <lb/>and the
                    dead, the Duke of <hi rend="smallcaps">Wellington</hi> being then close by
                    <lb/>him who desired he might carried to his tent.</p>
                <p>It must be some consolation to his afflicted family, that he <lb/>must have
                    distinguished himself in the opinion of his great <lb/>Commander, as he was
                    immediately recommended by him for <lb/>the rank of Major, though a very young
                    officer, and in a year <lb/>afterwards to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, with
                    the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of Adjutant-General in Ceylon, and if he had
                    then <lb/>fortunately sailed for India his life might probably have been
                    <lb/>saved ; but his disposition being as affectionate as it was ani<lb
                        break="no"/>mated, he could not be persuaded to leave Mrs <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Erskine</hi>, who <lb/>was pregnant, and remaining here
                    during the winter, the <lb/>cough, with consumptive symptoms, arising from his

                    lately deceased, was a young man of uncommon ener<lb break="no"/>gy of

                    and, as we understand, was about to return <lb/>to England, with the view of

                <p>By the Henry, arrived in the rive from Quebec, we <lb/>have advices from thence
                    of the 4th September, three <lb/>days later than the last accounts. They
                    confirm, we <lb/>regret to say, the intelligence received at Lloyd's on
                    <lb/>Friday, of the death of the Duke of Richmond, at <lb/>Montreal, where he
                    had arrived on his return from in<lb break="no"/>specting the new settlements in
                    Upper Canada. His <lb/>body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec, <lb/>where
                    it was lying in state at the time the Henry sail<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox, continued in <lb/>the most afflicting
                    state, and great fears were entertain<lb break="no"/>ed for her recovery.</p>
                <p>Lady Sarah Lennoc, his Grace's second daughter, <lb/>is married to Major-General
                    Sir Peregrine Maitland. <lb/>They accompanied his grace to North America, and
                    <lb/>have remained there since he entered upon his Govern<lb break="no"/>ment.
                    His Grace was the lineal descendant of the <lb/>first Duke of Richmond, natural
                    son of King Charles <lb/>II. by a French Lady, who was created by his Majesty
                    <lb/>Duchess of Portsmouth, and by Louis the Fourteenth, <lb/>Duchess of
                    Aubigny, in France. His titles were, <lb/>Duke of Richmond, Early of March
                    (English ho<lb break="no"/>nours) ; Duke of Aubigny, (French Honour) ; Duke
                    <lb/>of Lennox, Early of Darnley, and Baron Methuen of <lb/>Torbulton (Scots
                    Honours). The title of Aubigny was <lb/>confirmed in March 1816, by Louis XVIII
                    by caus<lb break="no"/>ing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him, and
                    <lb/>granting him the honours of the Louvre, as enjoyed by <lb/>his Grace's
                    ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General <lb/>in the army, Colonel of the 35th
                    regiment of foot, Go<lb break="no"/>nervor of Plymouth, Governor of Upper and
                    Lower <lb/>Canada and their dependencies, Lord Lieutenant of <lb/>the county of
                    Sussex, and High Steward of Chichester. <lb/>&#x2013;His Grace was born in 1764,
                    succeeded his uncle, <lb/>Charles, the late Duke, in 1806, and married in 1783
                    <lb/>Charlotte, daughter of Duke of Gordon, by whom <lb/>he had issue seven sons
                    and seven daughters, all of them <lb/>now living, except his third son, Henry
                    Adam, R. N. <lb/>who fell overboard the Blake, as she was sailing into <lb/>Port
                    Mahon, in 1812, and was drowned. His Grace <lb/>was distinguished early in life
                    by a duel with His <lb/>Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an <lb/>open,
                    candid, generous temper, and of plain and un<lb break="no"/>affected manners,
                    qualities which were particularly con<lb break="no"/>spicuous in Ireland, when
                    Viceroy of that country.</p>
                <p>His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest <lb/>son Charles, Earl of March,
                    now Duke of Richmond. <lb/>This young Nobleman in the army, has seen much active
                        ser<lb break="no"/>vice under the personal auspices of the illustrious
                        Wel<lb break="no"/>lington, being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp, and
                    <lb/>was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the <lb/>City of
                    Chichester, which seat, of course, becomes va<lb break="no"/>cant. He was lately
                    married to the eldest daughter of <lb/>the Marquis of Anglesea, and has issue, a
                    Son, now <lb/>Earl of March.</p>
                <p>The following is extracted from the Quebec papers:</p>
                <p>"Quebec, Thursday, Sept. 2. <lb/>"This Province has again been visited by one of
                    <lb/>those afflicting dispensations of Providence, which by <lb/>separating by
                    the hand of death, the ruler from the <lb/>people, covers whole communities with
                    mourning.</p>
                <p>"An express arrived here yesterday morning from <lb/>Montreal, with the
                    afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace <lb/>the Duke of Richmond, Governor
                    in Chief of these <lb/>Provinces, had died on his way from Kingston to Mon<lb
                        break="no"/>treal, at the moment that he was hourly expected to <lb/>join
                    his family there, from which he had separated in <lb/>good health at Kingston,
                    one the 20th, to complete by <lb/>visiting the new Settlements, the long and
                    arduous <lb/>journey in which he has been engaged.</p>
                <p>This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelli<lb break="no"/>gence, spread with
                    the greatest rapidity, and impressed <lb/>a deep gloom throughout the city. The
                    flag on the <lb/>citadel, and on all the vessels in the port, was hoisted
                    <lb/>half-mast, exhibiting every where the signals of public <lb/>mourning.</p>
                <p>"His Grace's body, immediately after his death, <lb/>was conveyed to Montreal. It
                    reached this city last <lb/>evening in the steam-boat <hi rend="italic"
                        >Malsham</hi>, and was remov<lb break="no"/>ed this forenoon to the Castle,
                    with the usual military <lb/>honours, and followed by his Grace's Staff, the
                        prin<lb break="no"/>cipal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Gar<lb
                        break="no"/>rison, and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants."</p>
                <p>September 5. <lb/>"His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal <lb/>to
                    Quebec, in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock, one the <lb/>morning of the 2d of Sept.
                    they were removed from the <lb/>vessel, and placed upon a hearse upon the King's
                    Wharf <lb/>at Quebec, from whence it was conveyed to the Cha<lb break="no"/>teau
                    of St. Louis, where they lay in state until four o'<lb break="no"/>clock on
                    Saturday the 4th September, when they were <lb/>removed to the place of
                    internment in the Cathedral <lb/>Church at Quebec.</p>
                <p>"On the corpse being brought out, the collar and <lb/>insignia of the Order of
                    the Garter, with his Grace's <lb/>military and other appointments being placed
                    on the cof<lb break="no"/>fin, the whole of the troops presented arms. On its
                    being <lb/>placed on the hearse, the troops rested on their arms
                    <lb/>reversed.</p>
                <p>"The procession then moved forward. It was com<lb break="no"/>posed of all the
                    principals persons attached to the pub<lb break="no"/>lic, military and civil
                    departments.</p>
                <p>"The military band filed off at the door of the Ca<lb break="no"/>thedral
                    Church-yard and conducted it up the centre <lb/>aisle, when it was played on a
                    platform, the mourners <lb/>remaining by the body. A signal was then given, when
                    <lb/>the body was deposited &#x2013; 15 guns being fired."</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated Quebec, Sept 5 :&#x2013;" When <lb/>I wrote the first
                    side, I did not expect so soon to com<lb break="no"/>municate the melancholy
                    event of the death of our Go<lb break="no"/>vernor, the Duke of Richmond, who
                    was attacked on his <lb/>route from Upper Canada, with symptoms of hydro<lb
                        break="no"/>phobia, which terminated his mortal career at six miles
                    <lb/>from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly <lb/>sensible of his
                    situation, and gave himself up from the <lb/>first spasm which attacked : it was
                    occasioned by <lb/>a bite of a tame fox at Sorel, on his way to Upper Ca<lb
                        break="no"/>nada, about three months since. His death, at this
                    <lb/>juncture, is looked on as very unfortuante for this coun<lb break="no"
                    />try, as he possessed the entire confidence of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and
                    was about completing a plan of defence for <lb/>the Canadas, which, when
                    executed, would establish a <lb/>water communication with our extreme points,
                        per<lb break="no"/>fectly free from interruption, in case of a war with the
                    <lb/>States."</p>
                <p>We are happy to learn, further, that no part of his <lb/>Grace's family was so
                    dangerously ill, as was at first <lb/>reported. They are only in that situation
                    which might <lb/>be expected, from so severe an affliction.</p>
                <p>Colonel Wilson had succeeded the late Duke of Rich<lb break="no"/>mond as
                    Governor-General of both Canadas, being the <lb/>senior Officer on that
                    station.</p>
                <p>Sir Charles Saxton, and Major M'Leod, Aides-de<lb break="no"/> Camp to his Grace
                    the Duke of Richmond, have gone <lb/>to Lake Winnipeg, clothed with special
                    powers, to in<lb break="no"/>vestigate the causes of the unhappy dissentions
                    which <lb/>are said to have been lately renewed in that quarter <lb/>between the
                    North West and Hudson's Bay Company. <lb/>By the new act, regulating the
                    commercial intercourse <lb/>between the province of Upper Canada and the United
                    <lb/>States, the duties on the importation of manufactures <lb/>and provisions
                    from the States are considerably reduc<lb break="no"/>ed on [?] of the
                    enumerated articles, although on <lb/>nails, snuff, manufactured tobacco, and
                    spirits, they are <lb/>riased. The <hi rend="italic">ad-valorem[?]</hi> duty is
                    reduced from 10 to 5 <lb/>per cent.</p>
                <p>Buffalo, Aug. 4. <lb/>On Friday, came[?] on before the Court of King's
                    <lb/>Beach, at Niagara, the trial of Robert Gourlay, Esq. <lb/>for a
                    misdemeanour, in not obeying the orders of the <lb/>Magistrates at Niagara, in
                    December last. Mr Gour<lb break="no"/>lay was found guilty, and banished the
                    province.</p>
                <p>From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August :?This <lb/>morning, about 9 o'clock,
                    Lieut. Birch, of the royal <lb/>navy, put a period to his existence by shooting
                    himself <lb/>through the head. We are informed that Mr Birch <lb/>had for
                    sometime previous to his death laboured under <lb/>a melancholy state of mind.

                    <lb/>The Annual Report of the Agricultural Society of <lb/>Quebec has been
                    published from which it is evident <lb/>that a laudable spirit of enterprise has
                    been awakened <lb/>in that important country. The Committee, who, in <lb/>the
                    execution of their functions travelled through the <lb/>greater part of Lower
                    Canada, conclude their Report by <lb/>putting on record a testimony they justly
                    conceive to be <lb/>honourable to the character of the inhabitants of the
                    <lb/>country through which they passed. Although many <lb/>hundreds of persons
                    from all parts of their respective <lb/>Counties attended the Agricultural
                    Meetings, which <lb/>were frequently of four or five hours duration, there
                    <lb/>did not occur at any of them a single instance of in<lb break="no"
                    />toxication, disorderly conduct or personal altercation.</p>
                <p>The Grand Jury at Nassau, New Providence, have <lb/>brought in a bill against Sir
                    Gregor M'Gregor, charging <lb/>him with aiding and abetting piracy, by issuing
                        com<lb break="no"/>missions in the Bahamas, to subjects of Power in
                    <lb/>unity[?] with Spain.</p>
                <p>A letter from Sierra Leone, dated the 9th of March <lb/>says&#x2013;" It is with
                    the deepest regret I inform you <lb/>that, notwithstanding the liberality of
                    Great Britain, <lb/>and the faith of Treaties, the coasts swarms with slave
                    <lb/>vessels, dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants <lb/>into endless
                    captivity. A few days ago arrived here <lb/>the Union, of Liverpool : the
                    Supercargo states, that <lb/>during his stay in the river Calabia, not less than
                    eight <lb/>vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sailed for the <lb/>Spanish
                    Colonies."</p>
                <p>We have received <hi rend="italic">Gibraltar Chronicles</hi> to the 10th
                    <lb/>ult. from which we learn that, in consequence of the <lb/>rapid increase of
                    the fever at the Isle de Leon, his Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency Governor Don had
                    issued a Proclamation on <lb/>the 2d ult. announcing that all communications
                    with <lb/>Spain (except through the customary process of qua<lb break="no"
                    />tine) would close at sun-set on the following even<lb break="no"/>ing. Notice
                    was also given to such of the labouring <lb/>classes as had not passed the
                    fever, that they would be <lb/>provided with tents and encamped on the neutral
                    ground <lb/>for their better security against infection should it un<lb
                        break="no"/>happily appears in the fortress. They would not be suffered
                    <lb/>to proceed to town, and follow their callings, during <lb/>the day, but
                    heir return to the encampment at night <lb/>was peremptorily enjoined.</p>
                <p>We are happy to learn, however, by the latest advices <lb/>from the British
                    fortress, that the garrison and inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants were not at all
                    infected with the disease.</p>

                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to America</hi>.</p>
                <p>In answer to the remarks which appeared in <lb/>our paper on Monday last,
                    respecting emigration <lb/>to America, and to the statements there given <lb/>of
                    the disadvantages which emigrants from <lb/>this country might expect to meet
                    with, we have <lb/>received a very abusive letter from an anony<lb break="no"
                    />mous correspondent, who appears very angry, <lb/>and, like most other angry
                    men, seems more <lb/>anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to as<lb
                        break="no"/>sign any good reason for it. His first cause of <lb/>quarrel is,
                    that we have stated the general want <lb/>of cleanliness to be a prevailing
                    defect in the <lb/>back parts of the United States. For this we <lb/>have the
                    authority of almost every traveller who <lb/>has visited those parts. The
                    remarks of Birkbeck <lb/>on this point are conclu-sive and striking:
                    &#x2013;</p>
                <p>' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and <lb/>' sketching, in a rude manner,
                    as I pass along, <lb/>' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de<lb
                        break="no"/>' formity so general, that I cannot help esteem<lb break="no"/>'
                    ing it national, though I know it admits of ve<lb break="no"/>' ry many
                    individual exceptions. I have written <lb/>' it, and then erased it, wishing to
                    pass it by, <lb/>' but it wont do &#x2013; it is the truth, and to the truth
                    <lb/>' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too <lb/>' often in person, is
                    neglected to a degree which <lb/>' is very revolting to an Englishman.</p>
                <p>' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a <lb/>' reproach &#x2013; for the
                    origin is most honourable ; <lb/>' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn
                    <lb/>' logs for a framed building, and that again for <lb/>' a mansion of brick,
                    some of her cabin habits <lb/>' have been unconsciously retained. Many have
                    <lb/>' already been quitted, and one by one they will <lb/>' all be cleared
                    away, as I am told they are now <lb/>' in the cities of the eastern states.</p>
                <p>' There are, I believe, court-houses, which <lb/>' are also made us of as places
                    of worship, in <lb/>' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating <lb/>' ever
                    since they were built. What reverence <lb/>' can be felt for the majesty of
                    religion, or of <lb/>' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The <lb/>'
                    people who are content to assemble in them <lb/>' can scarcely respect each
                    other. Here is a bad <lb/>' public example. It is said that to clean those
                    <lb/>' places is the office of no one. But why is no <lb/>' person appointed ?
                    Might it not be inferred <lb/>' that a disregard to the decencies of life
                    prevails <lb/>' through such a community?'</p>
                <p>To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the <lb/>' general (for there are many
                    exceptions) sloven<lb break="no"/>' liness about the homsteads, and particularly
                    <lb/>' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck <lb/>' complains of this,
                    and indeed what a contrast <lb/>' with the homesteads and cottages which he left
                    <lb/>' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild<lb break="no"/>' ford, in
                    Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the <lb/>reasons for this. When the first
                    settlers took <lb/>possession of the country, the ' example of neat<lb
                        break="no"/>' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were <lb/>' no
                    gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as <lb/>' drawing-rooms, with grass as even as
                    a car<lb break="no"/>' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec<lb break="no"/>'
                    tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who <lb/>' never have seen or heard of
                    perfection in these <lb/>' matters, will naturally be slovens.'</p>
                <p>He afterwards remarks &#x2013;</p>
                <p>' The market day at Guildford is a perfect <lb/>' show of cleanliness. Not even a
                    carter without <lb/>' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven <lb/>' and
                    clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, <lb/>' who came from this very spot,
                    think the people <lb/>' <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> in the western country.
                    I'll engage he <lb/>' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one <lb/>'
                    family of his present neighbours, than he left <lb/>' behind upon the skins of
                    all the people in <lb/>' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he <lb/>'
                    would not have found this to be the case in <lb/>' Pennsylvania, and especially
                    in those parts where <lb/>' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in <lb/>'
                    the New England States, the people are as <lb/>' cleanly and as neat as they are
                    in England. <lb/>' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu<lb break="no"/>'
                    trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the <lb/>' nastiest thing in
                    nature.'</p>
                <p>In answer to all this, our correspondent tells <lb/>us, that the Scotch are very
                    dirty. This, we <lb/>admit, was formerly, and may still continue in <lb/>some
                    degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch. <lb/>But does this reasonable person
                    mean to argue <lb/>from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and <lb/>ought not
                    to be corrected.</p>
                <p>With regard to the difficulties of effecting a <lb/>settlement, we are borne out
                    in our remarks on <lb/>this subject by the authority of various writers,
                    <lb/>and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's <lb/>Guide, a work of
                    great merit, which combines <lb/>an extent and precision of statistical
                        informa<lb break="no"/>tion altogether unequally, with the most enlar<lb
                        break="no"/>ged general views of the state of the country, <lb/>both
                    physical and moral. ' Most men (observes <lb/>' this judicious writer) on
                    arriving in the United <lb/>' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only <lb/>'
                    essential advantages offered are the security of <lb/>' person and property, and
                    the cheapness of land. <lb/>' It demands excessive labour, severe economy,
                    <lb/>' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to <lb/>' succeed in a newly
                    settled country ; and it de<lb break="no"/>' mands the permanency of this
                    continued la<lb break="no"/>' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.'</p>
                <p>Our anonymous correspondent is also ex<lb break="no"/>tremely displeased that we
                    have stated so strong<lb break="no"/>ly the perincious effects produced on the
                        gene<lb break="no"/>ral manners of the Americans by the existence <lb/>of
                    slavery ; and he mentions that many a labour<lb break="no"/>er in this country
                    might envy the condition of an <lb/>American slave. What are those privileges
                    for <lb/>which a free man should envy a slave he does <lb/>not think proper to
                    state. To show, however, <lb/>that we have not exaggerated the degradation
                    <lb/>and oppression of the coloured class in the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States,
                    we shall again adduce the authority of <lb/>the Emigrant's Guide. The author is
                        contradict<lb break="no"/>ing the notion that the labourer in the slave
                    <lb/>States is confounded with the negroe ; and he <lb/>expresses himself in the
                    following terms: &#x2013;</p>
                <p>' A residence of 16 years in places where sla<lb break="no"/>' very is prevalent,
                    enables us to contradict a <lb/>' general expression, that, in such places,
                    whites, <lb/>' performing manual labour, are confounded in <lb/>' the moral
                    estimates of the people with slaves. <lb/>' Though less respect is certainly
                    paid to useful <lb/>' labour in the slave states than where all the <lb/>'
                    duties are performed by whites, yet <lb/>' the distance between the two races of
                    men are <lb/>' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and <lb/>' inveterate is
                    the feeling on that subject, that <lb/>' not any where in the United States can
                        pro<lb break="no"/>' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other <lb/>'
                    advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi<lb break="no"/>' nion a man the
                    most remotely allied to the <lb/>' African, to a rank equal to the meanest
                    white. <lb/>' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi<lb break="no"/>' ana
                    will be witness to some very remarkable <lb/>' exemplifications of this innate
                    contempt for all <lb/>' those who affinity involve them in the con<lb break="no"
                    />' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.'</p>
                <p>What a picture is here conveyed of misery <lb/>and degradation on the one hand,
                    and of tyranny <lb/>on the other. &#x2013; Here we find it failry confessed
                    <lb/>that no degree of worth, whether moral or intel<lb break="no"/><cb/>
                    <lb/>lectual, not even the possession of property, can <lb/>give a man the least
                    degree of consideration in <lb/>the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot
                    <lb/>conceive a community more wretchedly consti<lb break="no"/>tuted. All that
                    is estimable and worthy is here <lb/>utterly contemned, because the individual
                    who <lb/>possesses these qualities happens to have his skin <lb/>of a particular
                    colour, and thus a merely acci<lb break="no"/>dental quality of the corporeal
                    frame entails <lb/>upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy <lb/>and
                    contempt. These distinctions, carried to <lb/>such an excess, seem to us to be
                    founded on the <lb/>extinction of every generous and honourable sen<lb
                        break="no"/>timent, and we cannot help still asserting that <lb/>we had
                    rather live we at present are, than <lb/>in a community where such hateful
                    antipathies <lb/>rule to the exclusion of every just and humane
                    <lb/>feeling.</p>
                <p>With regard to the condition of the negroe <lb/>slaves we shall quote a passage
                    from Brown's <lb/>Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory <lb/>after reading
                    which, we shall leave our anony<lb break="no"/>mous correspondent to say whether
                    he thinks <lb/>the condition of a labourer in this country pre<lb break="no"
                    />ferable to that of being an African slave. The <lb/>writer, describing the
                    town of Lexington, in <lb/>Kentucky, observes &#x2013;</p>
                <p>' In this square stands the market-house, <lb/>' which is of brick, and well
                    furnished on Wed<lb break="no"/>' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the
                    <lb/>' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here <lb/>' that incorrigible
                    or delinquent negroes are <lb/>' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment
                    <lb/>' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their <lb/>' screams soon collected a
                    numerous crowd ; I <lb/>' could not help saying to myself, " These cries <lb/>'
                    are the knell of Kentucky libery.' "</p>
                <p>Having made this answer to the angry charges <lb/>thus brought against us, we
                    have only to dis<lb break="no"/>claim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or
                        pre<lb break="no"/>judice against the Americans. We have no <lb/>wish either
                    to depreciate their character or in<lb break="no"/>stitutions. They exhibit the
                    interesting spectacle <lb/>of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace
                    <lb/>to wealth and greatness. To revile such a <lb/>people would be the height
                    of human folly, and <lb/>equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to
                    <lb/>take offence because endeavour to make a <lb/>fair estimate of their
                    character, without hiding <lb/>any of its defects.</p>

                    4.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lord Selkirk vs. North West Company</hi>.</p>
                <p>On Friday, the 30th of October, the Court of Oyer <lb/>and Terminer proceeded to
                    try the gentlemen accused <lb/>as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple,
                    Esq. <lb/>and others at Red River, on the 19th of June, 1816 <lb/>and the trial
                    was rendered extremely interesting by the <lb/>disclousure which took place of
                    many extraordinary cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya
                    and <lb/>North West Companies, which for some time past has <lb/>excited so much
                    of the public attention in this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The gentlemen tried on
                    this occasion were, <lb/>Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie, <lb/>Hugh M'Gillis,
                    <lb/>Simon Fraser, <lb/>John Macdonald, and <lb/>John M'Laughlin <lb/>} accused
                    as accessories <lb/>after the fact. <lb/>and Mr John Severlight, accused as an
                    accessory <hi rend="italic">before</hi>
                    <lb/>and <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the fact.</p>
                <p>It appeared in evidence that the North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany had been
                    upwards of thirty years in possession <lb/>of trading posts called <hi
                        rend="italic">forts</hi> at different points on the <lb/>Red River in the
                    Indian Territories, and it is well <lb/>known that for a century before the
                    North West Com<lb break="no"/>pany, the Canadian for traders had been in the
                        con<lb break="no"/>stant practise of resorting to that country which was
                    <lb/>visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's <lb/>Bay Company
                    about twenty-five years ago. It was <lb/>put in evidence that for many years
                    afterwards both <lb/>companies carried on their trade to Red River without
                    <lb/>interference in each others pursuits, and without any <lb/>disturbance in
                    the country ; and it was explained that <lb/>the principal object of the trade
                    being to collect pro<lb break="no"/>visions, (enlisting chiefly of the dried
                    flesh of the buf<lb break="no"/>falo, which abound in the plains) and the
                    country pro<lb break="no"/>ducing abundance for the supply of both parties, the
                    <lb/>same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading <lb/>stations where
                    the fine furs are obtained in small quan<lb break="no"/>tities, and where rival
                    traders would at all times be <lb/>likely to dispute about the divisions of
                    them. The Red <lb/>River country therefore remained quiet and undisturb<lb
                        break="no"/>ed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists <lb/>and
                    Servants, and the attempts made by their leaders <lb/>to prevent the usual
                    supplies of provisions from being <lb/>obtained by the traders.</p>
                <p>The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-dis<lb break="no"/>ant <hi
                        rend="italic">Governor of Ossinibour</hi>, prohibiting the exporta<lb
                        break="no"/>tion of provisions from Red River, was the first docu<lb
                        break="no"/>ment produced for the defence at the recent trials. It <lb/>was
                    proved that, under this assumed authority, several <lb/>acts of violence were
                    committed by Mr Macdonnell and <lb/>his followers. Trading posts and buildings
                    were for<lb break="no"/>cibly entered, depots of provisions seized, the river
                    (the <lb/>only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries <lb/>mounted with
                    cannon, and the trade of the North <lb/>West Company wholly interdicted, before
                    any acts of <lb/>retaliation were attempted on their part, and even be<lb
                        break="no"/>fore they took any precautions for their own defence <lb/>or for
                    ensuring the safety of their provisions, on which <lb/>depended the existence of
                    their trade, and the lives of <lb/>their people.</p>
                <p>Mutual and continual acts of aggression and ret<lb break="no"/>aliation appeared
                    to have exasperated the minds of both <lb/>parties, and to have rendered them so
                    suspicious of the <lb/>designs of each other as to be always on their guard
                    <lb/>and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in <lb/>evidence that the
                    country remained in a state of pri<lb break="no"/>vate war, which at length
                    ended in the <hi rend="italic">battle</hi> of the <lb/>loch of Jane, 1816. The
                    particulars of this unfort<lb break="no"/>unate affray were fully investigated
                    in the trial of Bouche <lb/>and Brown for murder, as <hi rend="italic"
                        >principals</hi>. The state<lb break="no"/>ments on both sides are already
                    before the public, and <lb/>the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently
                    that the <lb/>jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been <lb/>the
                    assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories <lb/>the cirumstances which
                    led to the meeting of the hos<lb break="no"/>tile parties were made out in the
                    evidence to the following <lb/>effect, viz : &#x2013;</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">March</hi>, 1816, Mr Colin Robertson, with an <lb/>armed
                    party, acting under the orders of <hi rend="italic">Governor</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">Semple</hi>, who had succeeded <hi rend="italic"
                        >Governor</hi> Miles Macdonnell <lb/>at Red River, captured by surprise the
                    North West <lb/>trading post at the forks of the river, called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Fort</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">Gibraltar</hi>, and took possession of all the stores and
                    <lb/>provisions. In the latter part of the following month <lb/>of May, Governor
                    Semple caused the buildings (which <lb/>were of wood) to be taken to pieces, and
                    the materials <lb/>were floated fown the river in rafts, to be used in con<lb
                        break="no"/>structing his new fort, which he called <hi rend="italic">Fort
                        Douglas</hi>
                    <lb/>and where, (following the examples of his predecessors) <lb/>he mounted
                    cannon to command the passage of the <lb/>river, built an armed schooner, or
                    gun-boat, to com<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>plete the blockage, and effectually to intercept the pro<lb break="no"
                    />visions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. <lb/>Alexander Macdonnell, a
                    partner of the North West <lb/>Company, who had charge of their provisions at
                        Ri<lb break="no"/>viere Qui Appele, one of the branches of the Red River,
                    <lb/>became alarmed at these measures of hostility, and as<lb break="no"
                    />sembled as many people as he could (half breeds and <lb/>others) for the
                    protection of the property under his care, <lb/>with which, at the usual time,
                    he proceeded down the <lb/>river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor
                    <lb/>Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions, made <lb/>dispositions to
                    defend them, if attacked, and sent a <lb/>party of his people, with a temporary
                    supply to meet <lb/>the canoes from below, apprise them of the blockages,
                    <lb/>and concert with them the means of eluding or re<lb break="no"/>moving it.
                    This party, under the direction of Cuth<lb break="no"/>bert Grant (a half breed,
                    and a clerk of the N. West <lb/>Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas
                    <lb/>in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon, and <lb/>to carry these
                    provisions in carts, at as great a distance <lb/>as possible from the fort, so
                    as to avoid being seen.&#x2013; <lb/>This it was fully proved they did ; but a
                    swamp in the <lb/>rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about <lb/>two
                    miles of it, and being deserted and pursued from <lb/>then, the conflict ensued
                    in which Mr Semple, and <lb/>most of his party, were killed.</p>
                <p>It was further made out in evidence that in the <lb/>Spring of the year 1816, the
                    agent of the North West <lb/>Company at Montreal were still in need of more than
                    <lb/>the usual supply of provisions from the Red River, be<lb break="no"/>cause
                    there had not yet been time to replace the ves<lb break="no"/>sels on the lakes,
                    and the other means of transport <lb/>which the Americans had destroyed during
                    the war, <lb/>nor to replenish their stores at Fort William, with the <lb/>usual
                    quantity of provisions from Canada. Having <lb/>also heard of the seizure of one
                    of their posts at Red <lb/>River in the fall of the year 1815, and apprehending
                    <lb/>further aggressions in the spring, Mr M'Leod, one of <lb/>the agents, with
                    all the partners and clerks who could <lb/>be spared from Montreal, proceeded up
                    the country <lb/>early in the Spring, and on arriving at Fort William,
                    <lb/>received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar <lb/>and the
                    blockade of Red River, towards which place <lb/>he immediately proceeded with as
                    many of the part<lb break="no"/>ners, clerks, and servants of the Company as he
                    could <lb/>collect by the way, in order to rescue the intercepted
                    <lb/>provisions, in the defence of which, or in their own <lb/>defence, if fired
                    on by Semple's blockading battery, it <lb/>was their avowed purpose to use force
                    if necessary, but <lb/>it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders
                    <lb/>issued to their cannonmen, were, to pass Fort Douglas <lb/>singing, and to
                    proceed up the river for their provi<lb break="no"/>sions, without landing or
                    molesting any one unless <lb/>they should be attacked.&#x2013;They arrived at
                    Red River <lb/>three days after the battle, and Mr M'Leod, who was <lb/>a
                    Magistrate, being of opinion that Mr Semple's party <lb/>had been the
                    assailants, and that the half breeds had <lb/>only acted in self defence, did
                    not adopt any measures <lb/>against them, (the half breeds) but, on the
                    contrary, <lb/>expressed approbation for their having defended their
                    <lb/>provisions, and gave them the supplies of clothing, &amp;c. <lb/>usually
                    given to all the servants of the North West <lb/>Company, while, at the same
                    time, he arrest some <lb/>of the survivors of Mr Semple's party, and served
                        sub<lb break="no"/>poenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions
                    <lb/>in the Courts of Lower Canada. <cb/>
                    <lb/>This was the whole of the evidence, and the only <lb/>circumstances which
                    appeared relative to the prisoners, <lb/>were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged
                    accessory before <lb/>the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he
                    <lb/>sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions <lb/>past Fort
                    Douglas, and that the alleged accessaries <lb/>after the fact arrived at Red
                    River with Mr M'Leod, <lb/>after the battle was over, and appeared to consider
                    it, <lb/>as it is now found to have been, an affray in which the
                    <lb/>unsuccessful party were to blame, and in which the <lb/>successful party
                        <hi rend="italic">were not murderers</hi>&#x2013;The Judge who <lb/>presided
                    at the trial, declared in his charge to the jury <lb/>that there was not a <hi
                        rend="italic">scintilla</hi> of evidence " against any <lb/>one of these
                    gentlemen," and the jury accordinagly re<lb break="no"/>turned a verdict of <hi
                        rend="italic">Not Guilty</hi>.</p>
                <p>It will be recollected that these gentlemen were ar<lb break="no"/>rested by the
                    Earl of Selkirk, at Fort William, in Aug <lb/>1815, on the charges of High
                    Treason and Conspi<lb break="no"/>racy, as well as Murder&#x2013;and that the
                    buildings and <lb/>property of the North West Company at that place <lb/>were
                    forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an <lb/>armed force under his
                    Lordship's command. The <lb/>North West Company represented at the time that
                    these <lb/>accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the
                    <lb/>preconcerted plunder of their property, and destruction <lb/>of their
                    trade, while, on the part of Lord Selkirk, it <lb/>was alleged that the crimes
                    committed by the partners <lb/>of the North West Company were so atrocious, as
                    to <lb/>justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and <lb/>for some time
                    the public opinion remained in suspense <lb/>as to the real merits of the case.
                    So far as regarded <lb/>the seizure of property and the interruption of trade,
                    <lb/>the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Procla<lb break="no"/>mation
                    of the 3rd of May, 1817, in consequence of <lb/>which the North West Company
                    recovered possession <lb/>of their property, and re-established their trade ;
                    but <lb/>that proclamation left the rights of parties, and the <lb/>crimes
                    alleged against the individuals, to be investigated <lb/>and decided upon by the

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Reform in Upper Canada</hi>
                </p>
                <p>It has been already mentioned that Governor <lb/>Maitland, on opening the session
                    of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of Upper Canada, recommended that mea<lb
                        break="no"/>sures should be taken to prevent the meeting <lb/>of delegates
                    for obtaining reform in Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>da. Accounts from Quebec and
                    Montreal, da<lb break="no"/>ted the end of November, state, that in pursu<lb
                        break="no"/>ance of this recommendation, the Legislature, <lb/>on one of the
                    first days of its meeting, appoint<lb break="no"/>ed a Committee to inquire into
                    the subject, who <lb/>almost instantly came to the following resolu<lb
                        break="no"/>tion :?</p>
                <p>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee that <lb/>some such
                    legislative provision should be enacted as the wis<lb break="no"/>dom of the
                    Imperial Parliament has found it proper to pro<lb break="no"/>vide to meet
                    similar occasions, to put it out of the power of <lb/>any designing persons to
                    organize discontent.</p>
                <p>The proceeding appears to have raised the in<lb break="no"/>dignation of the
                    Gourlay or reofrming party in <lb/>Upper Canada, as will be seen by the
                    following <lb/>extract :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>Montreal, November 21. <lb/>This legislative provision, it will be immediate<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ly perceived, is the suspension of the Habeas <lb/>Corpus act, for that was
                    the course pursued in <lb/>England. We do not believe that there is the
                    <lb/>most remote necessity for such a measure. We <lb/>do not hesitate to say,
                    that the members have <lb/>not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents,
                    <lb/>in their echo of Sir P. Maitland's speech, with <lb/>the most humiliating
                    servility ; and we feel con<lb break="no"/>vinced that it will not be borne with
                    by the <lb/>people, while they have the control in any way <lb/>of their
                    representatives. The sentiment therein <lb/>attempted to be disseminated is
                    an</p>
                <p><pb/>libel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. <lb/>It would sound in our
                    ears like the knell of their <lb/>liberty, if we were not persuaded, that its
                        adop<lb break="no"/>tion would provoke a spirit of resistance, not
                    <lb/>corporal, but mental ; not secret and illegal, but <lb/>open and
                    legitimate, which (if the Administra<lb break="no"/>tion do not take the
                    decision of the question <lb/>from the people by force, and we believe they
                    <lb/>cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the con<lb break="no"/>stitution
                    of the united province from the injury <lb/>which it has received by
                    mal-administration.</p>

                <p>The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst <lb/>the numerous overt acts

                    <lb/>entry of them, by force of arms, into Fort William, <lb/>in August, 1816 ;
                    retaining possession of the fort till <lb/>May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners
                    the partners of <lb/>the North West Company found there ; getting rid of
                    <lb/>the clerks, by subpoenas to appear at York at a period <lb/>when no courts

                    matters to which <lb/>the subpoenas related, and without ever bringing them
                    <lb/>forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going <lb/>into the
                    interior, and the returns from coming into <lb/>Montreal ; possessing themselves
                    of all the books and <lb/>papers of the concern ; sending away the principal
                    <lb/>clerk under a charge of felony, without examination, <lb/>and without

                        advis<lb break="no"/>ing them to abandon their trust, alleging that the
                    <lb/>North West Company were ruined, and to carry the <lb/>furs to Hudson's Bay

                </p>
                <p>This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith <lb/>against Lord Selkirk for false
                    imprisonment.</p>
                <p>It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was under<lb break="no"/> sheriff of
                    the Western District, and as such, the bear<lb break="no"/>er of a writ of
                    restitution founded upon a verdict of a <lb/>special jury at Sandwich, in
                    October 1816, and grant<lb break="no"/>ed by the Magistrate, ordering the
                    restoration of Fort <lb/>William to the North West Company. He was also <lb/>the
                    bearer of a warrant, for felony, issued against his <lb/>Lordship, Dr Allen,
                    Captain Matthey, and others, u<lb break="no"/>pon an information upon oath
                    before a justice of the <lb/>Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of
                    <lb/>March 1817, and produced his writ of restitution, <lb/>with which his
                    Lordship refused to comply ; and when <lb/>the Earl and others were arrested by
                    Mr Smith, upon <lb/>the warrant for felony, his Lordship laid hold of him
                    <lb/>and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards <lb/>kept in close
                    custody in the fort under a military guard. <lb/>A circumstance which added much
                    to the grievous na<lb break="no"/>ture of the offence, and which was
                    particularly dwelt <lb/>upon by the Judge, in his charge to the Jury, was, that
                    <lb/>whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement, <lb/>Charles de
                    Reinhard, though under an accusation of <lb/>was at large and keeping a school,
                    though no<lb break="no"/>minally under the surveillance of one or two of his
                        for<lb break="no"/>mer comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon a<lb
                        break="no"/>nother part of the evidence for the defence, by which <lb/>it
                    appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to ob<lb break="no"/>tain his
                    liberty was that of abandoning his duty, and <lb/>breaking his oath of office,
                    by a promise not to molest <lb/>Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith, however, notwithstanding
                    <lb/>this proposal, persisted in doing his duty, and was not <lb/>liberated
                    until the evacuation of Fort William by his <lb/>Lordship and his forces in May,
                    1818.</p>
                <p>The Jury after some deliberation, returned a verdict <lb/>in favour of the

                    <lb/>and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally <lb/>blown to pieces.
                    His body was raised a few feet in the <lb/>air by the explosion, and he fell

                    have been somewhat alarmed here <lb/>to-day, though no bad consequences have
                    followed, by a most <lb/>numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and
                    other <lb/>artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Arm<lb break="no"
                    />ley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages <lb/>and it is
                    computed that at one time there were full three <lb/>thousand of these
                    distressed people assembled, chiefly in Brig<lb break="no"/>gate. As many of
                    them marched into the town with great <lb/>sticks in their hands, they created
                    some little alarm, but their <lb/>conduct was uniformly peaceable; their
                    complaints were not <lb/>loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and
                    <lb/>Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in rea<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>diness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, <lb/>there
                    was not the slightest occasion for their interference. <lb/>By far the greater
                    number of the assemblage dispersed by noon, <lb/>and returned to their
                    respective homes. Several respectable <lb/>gentlemen went among them, to
                    ascertain the motives of <lb/>their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it
                    does not ap<lb break="no"/>pear that they have the least disposition to commit
                    any breath <lb/>of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do
                    <lb/>in their present state of distress. I understand that an active
                    <lb/>subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor <lb/>men to proceed
                    to Canada; and others are said to have ex<lb break="no"/>pressed their wish to
                    be sent to Botany Bay, provided they <lb/>can obtain the sanction of Government.
                    The case of these <lb/>people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers
                    augment <lb/>daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories.</p>

                <p>We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultu<lb break="no"/>ral poor
                    are out of employ in Monmouthshire, and that the <lb/>amount of wages diminishes
                    as works get scarcer. Emigra<lb break="no"/>tion to America still continues; but
                    it is, for the most part, of <lb/>a description of person who have afforded
                    employ to others <lb/>rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some
                    <lb/>property with them.</p>
                <p>Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there <lb/>are twenty six
                    persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of <lb/>the name of Thistlewaith,)
                    lately residing in Meadow lane, <lb/>Leeds. These industrious and enterprising
                    individuals are <lb/>gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen
                        manufac<lb break="no"/>ture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive
                    scale, ei<lb break="no"/>ther at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site
                    in its <lb/>vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate <lb/>from
                    the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, <lb/>Bradford, and other
                    places in the vicinity. It is true these <lb/>extensive emigrations may, in some
                    degree, contribute to re<lb break="no"/>lieve our overburdened population ; but
                    they must likewise <lb/>tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the nation ; as
                    every <lb/>individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecu<lb
                        break="no"/>niary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more
                    <lb/>consequence to a commercial nation&#x2013;their talents and in<lb
                        break="no"/>dustry&#x2013;articles, at present, of comparative small value
                    in the <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon au<lb break="no"/>thors and
                    publishers, by being compelled, under the existing <lb/>Copyright Act to deliver
                    eleven copies of every book publish<lb break="no"/>ed to certain public
                    libraries, is likely to be repealed by a Bill <lb/>to be brought into Parliament
                    in a few days. The body of <lb/>evidence taken before the Select Committe of the
                    House of <lb/>Commons last year, forms a most interesting display of the

                    Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury <lb/>against five of the principal
                    witnesses produced in behalf of <lb/>the petitioner, who were examined before
                    the Select Com<lb break="no"/>mittee appointed to try the merits of the election
                    fo Penrhyn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extraordinary Legacy.</hi>&#x2013;A very singular cause is now
                        de<lb break="no"/>pending before the Court of Session in Scotland,
                    respecting a <lb/>legacy to the amount of upwards of <hi rend="italic">fifty
                        thousand pounds,</hi>be<lb break="no"/>queathed by the late Earl of F. (who
                    died at Berlin) to a fo<lb break="no"/>reigner, who was one of his domestic
                    servants. The payment <lb/>of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the
                    late Earl, <lb/>on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consi<lb
                        break="no"/>deration ; and from its novelty the case is, of course, the
                        sub<lb break="no"/>ject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The
                    <lb/>arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit, in which <lb/>the most
                    eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged, <lb/>display much classical as
                    well as legal learning ; but no judg<lb break="no"/>ement has yet been
                    pronounced by the Court. From the mag<lb break="no"/>nitude of the sum in
                    dispute, it will probably be finally de<lb break="no"/>termined by an appeal to
                    the House of Lords.&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">Morn. Chron.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Town Hall, Southwark.</hi>&#x2013;Thomas Wing was brought up by
                    <lb/>Reeve, the Marshalman, and examined before Sir John Earner[?], <lb/>the
                    sitting Magistrate, charged on suspicion of robbing his em<lb break="no"
                    />ployers, Messrs Sentance and Flint, grocers, NO. 300. Borough,
                    <lb/>High-street.</p>
                <p>The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singu<lb break="no"/>lar
                    manner :&#x2013;He was porter to the prosecutors, and was fre<lb break="no"
                    />quently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him <lb/>take money
                    from the till, which he tied in his pocket hand<lb break="no"/>kerchief,
                    followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a <lb/>shed near the stables,
                    and then he came into the shop and ap<lb break="no"/>peared quite restless,
                    pulling every person by the skirt[?] and <lb/>apparently wishing them to follow
                    him. At length Henry <lb/>Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the
                    stable, <lb/>the dog followed him, and having drawn his attention to the
                    <lb/>heap of rubbish, under which the money was buried, began to <lb/>scratch at
                    it till he brought the booty to view ! The appren<lb break="no"/>tice brought it
                    to his master, who counted, and found it to <lb/>contain 12s. in copper coin.
                    After marking it he desired the <lb/>boy to place it in the same spot, which he
                    did, and soon af<lb break="no"/>terwards, finding that it was removed, he asked
                    the prisoner <lb/>some questions about it, but he declared his ignorance of the
                    <lb/>whole transaction. Reeve, the Marshalman, was then sent <lb/>for, who, on
                    searching the prisoner, found some of the marked <lb/>ballpence[?] in his
                    pocket.&#x2013;Remanded. <cb/>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">Bank Committee.</hi>&#x2013;The Opposition Journals, last
                    wek, as<lb break="no"/>serted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House
                    of <lb/>Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of <lb/>paying
                    in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January <lb/>in gold bars at the
                    present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, <lb/>any quanitity of notes not being
                    less than sixty or a hundred <lb/>pounds' worth, and that in two years
                    afterwards they shall <lb/>pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold,
                    L.3, 17s. <lb/>10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It re<lb
                        break="no"/>commends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars
                    <lb/>of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall <lb/>at all
                    times buy gold, when offered, at L.3, 17s. and sell it, <lb/>when demanded, at
                    L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d.</p>
                <p>If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the <lb/>Restriction
                    Committee intend to report in favour of payments <lb/>in bullion at the market
                    price ; and should Parliament adopt <lb/>that plan ; then there will be a very
                    great saving to the na<lb break="no"/>tion in the expense of coinage, the waste
                    of, &amp;c. All <lb/>the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in
                        fo<lb break="no"/>reign commerce, will be answered as well by payments in
                    gold <lb/>bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run <lb/>on
                    the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, <lb/>will be completely
                    prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, <lb/>the only danger to which it is
                    exposed. A run for coin on <lb/>the Country Banks would instantly fall on the
                    Bank of England, <lb/>and would cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the
                    <lb/>empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Op<lb break="no"
                    />position Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in <lb/>perfect
                    security, at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to dis<lb break="no"/>order it.
                    If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase <lb/>gold bars or foreign coin,
                    or content themselves with silver.</p>
                <p>In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the <lb/>amount of L.800,000
                    each year, and then the value of gold <lb/>was rather below the standard price.
                    In the year 1817 we <lb/>imported to the amount of six millions, and in the year
                    1818 <lb/>we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. Du<lb break="no"
                    />ring the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have <lb/>an
                    abundant harvest or two, and little importation of corn <lb/>become necessary,
                    gold will again fall very low. The Bank <lb/>will then be able to pay, to buy
                    gold to the full extent of Mr <lb/>Ricardo's plan, and to place their notes on a
                    firm, unques<lb break="no"/>tionable foundation. The finances of the continent,
                    and of <lb/>the world, indeed&#x2013;the sources and circulation of money will,
                    <lb/>during peace, gradually become steadier and better known. <lb/>The East
                    Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quan<lb break="no"/>tity of
                    specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her <lb/>troubles, yields far
                    less than usual. It would be madness to <lb/>fly in the face of all these
                    circumstances, by compelling the <lb/>Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may
                    be desirable to li<lb break="no"/>mit the issue of bank notes to some certain,
                    yet liberal amount. <lb/>We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the
                    Committee ; <lb/>but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?]
                    <lb/>is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone in <lb/>voting
                    against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be <lb/>in favour of a very
                    sudden or decided plan for the resumpion <lb/>of cash payments, or Mr Tierney
                    would not have voted against <lb/>it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable
                    prospect of a rational <lb/>scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six
                        Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion Members of the Committee would not have voted for
                    it. <lb/>&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</p>

                    Keans. The sports were <lb/>as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds, and the

                    a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club <lb/>was at first backed
                    to win, but the England shots were now <lb/>backed freely at six to four, as
                    they were considered safe <lb/><hi rend="italic">eighteen</hi> bird men. Mr King
                    killed twenty, but lost two out <lb/>of bounds. Short missed his first three,
                    which brought bet<lb break="no"/>ting to two to one onn the Club, but he killed
                    the next seven<lb break="no"/>teen, and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had
                    seventeen to <lb/>tie, and eighteen to win, and he was back at five to four
                    <lb/>and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. <lb/>He,
                    however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the o<lb break="no"/>ther four
                    to win. He succeeded, and the prize was won by once <lb/>bird. It was altogether
                    the most interesting match of this <lb/>sort known for years.</p>
                <p>Letters from Petersburgh, of the 15th ultimo, mention that <lb/>Prince Gustavus
                    of Sweden, son of King Gustavus IV., has <lb/>obtained permission from the

                    his studies at Ox<lb break="no"/>ford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and
                    talents of this <lb/>unfortunate young Prince, who excites universal interest
                    and <lb/>sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must <lb/>largely
                    share, for we cannot easily forget the associations with <lb/>which the name of

                    <lb/>whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial, has settled <lb/>upon
                    Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2,000 Sterling per <lb/>annum, during the
                    residence of the latter in England, and that <lb/>on the return of his Royal

                <p>Some Canada papers to the 11th let. have arrived in <lb/>town. Sir Peregrine
                    Maitland had summoned the <lb/>Parliament of Upper Canada to meet him at York,
                    on <lb/>the 22d of April. He had appointed Port Talbot in <lb/>the town of
                    Dunwich, a port of entry, in the same <lb/>manner as those established between
                    Canada and the <lb/> United Statess.</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter to a Gentleman in George-town, <lb/>dated Tobago, Feb. 9.
                    1819.&#x2013;' The heavy rains <lb/>which continued during the months of
                    December and <lb/>January, almost inundated the country, which brought <lb/>on a
                    most rapid and fatal disease, which made its first <lb/>appearance in the frost,
                    at a short distance from the <lb/>town, consisting of 212 men strong, and in 10
                    or 12 <lb/>days, 45 of that number were numbered with the dead. <lb/>The
                    contagion was so rapid, that it soon spread into <lb/>the town, shipping, and
                    country, and proved equally <lb/>fatal. The disorder was such, it baffled all
                    medical <lb/>aid. The alarming symptoms were such, that business <lb/>was nearly

                    in the remote and healthiest <lb/>part of this. I assure you, that every thing
                    had a <lb/>most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so con<lb break="no"
                    />tagious, one man would hardly venture to touch ano<lb break="no"/>ther. The

                    her&#x2013;some have since died ; and <lb/>some remain sick. The weather has

                <p>A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes, to the 20th of <lb/>February, have reached us.
                    They contain no intelli<lb break="no"/>gence of particular interest, expect that
                    the colony ap<lb break="no"/>pears to have been healthy at that period. In one
                    of <lb/>them we find a contradiction of the reports which <lb/>found their way
                    into the English papers some months <lb/>since of the dreadful mortality that
                    prevailed in that <lb/>settlement. It states that the "total number of Euro<lb
                        break="no"/>peans who died in the Peninsula in 1818, was eight <lb/>men,
                    three women, and two children. We lost no ci<lb break="no"/>vil, military or
                    colonial officer, excepting one young <lb/>Gentleman who died a month after his
                    arrival, and is <lb/>included in the number."</p>
                <p>A letter from the Havannah, dated 27th February, <lb/>mentions that the article
                    of coffee is gradually rising <lb/>in value, and that an agent from Messrs
                    Baring is <lb/>making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million
                    <lb/>sterling, in that single commodity.</p>

                        Hunt, esq.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>"Washington Hotel, New Orleans, Dec. 25. 1818.</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Brother</hi> &#x2013; We arrived safe in the mouth
                    of <lb/>the Mississippi on the 10th of this month, after a voyage <lb/>of 82
                    days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in <lb/>excellent health, and very
                    happy. There are 35 English <lb/>vessels from Liverpool now here, and a great
                    many Eng<lb break="no"/>lish emigrants from Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lanca<lb
                        break="no"/>shire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somersetshire ; and, <lb/>in
                    fact, from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island <lb/>we have left behind
                    us ! Our ship was detained near a <lb/>week in the river, about 80 miles below
                    New Orleans ; <lb/>we all went on shore, and had plenty of rabbit shooting.
                    <lb/>I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun, by Knock, <lb/>corner of
                    Fetter-lane. Henry, myself, and Mr Blake <lb/>went one day into the woods to
                    kill deer, by night co<lb break="no"/>ming on, we lost our road ; and, differing
                    in opinions, we <lb/>separated, Henry and Mr Blake taking one road, and my<lb
                        break="no"/>self the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten
                    <lb/>o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods, <lb/>and did not
                    return to us till the next morning. It being <lb/>wet, and Henry sleeping on the
                    marshy ground, in spite <lb/>of the remonstrances of Mr Blake, caught a severe
                    cold, <lb/>and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days, <lb/>but he is
                    now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In <lb/>the river there are thousands
                    of wild swans, wild geese, <lb/>wild ducks, woodcocks, snipes, and other wild
                    fowl. If <lb/>you were there, you would kill a waggon load in a day, <lb/>as I
                    know you have frequently killed a horse load in Eng<lb break="no"/>land ; but
                    they are a thousand times more numerous here <lb/>than I ever saw them in
                    England ; this market swarms <lb/>with them, and very cheap. No game certificate
                    required <lb/>here. Myself, Henry, Mr Blake, and the other passen<lb break="no"
                    />gers, visited a French farmer, about six miles below New <lb/>Orleans : he has
                    got 3000 acres of his own land, whereon <lb/>are sugar plantations,
                    sugar-houses, &amp; c. ; he made <lb/>250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last
                    year. He offers <lb/>five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter,
                    <lb/>as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French <lb/>settlements
                    on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are <lb/>the most slovenly and the
                    worst farmers I ever saw. &#x2013; <lb/> They are very lazy, bad managers, and
                    appear to use <lb/>their negroes very cruel, and work them very hard. The
                    <lb/>Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer, <lb/>as it is very
                    unhealthy in the hot weather and the <lb/>deaths are frequently seventy in a
                    week. The scenery <lb/>of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much
                    like <lb/>the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and <lb/>Staines, and
                    many of the buildings are as handsome as <lb/>those of Bath. Here is one Church,
                    which is a very <lb/>beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spa<lb
                        break="no"/>nish shops are all open, and it is a market during the
                    <lb/>whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening, <lb/>gambling &amp;
                    c. We are at the Washington Hotel, the <lb/>best in the city ; it is expensive,
                    although very good <lb/>living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each, including
                    <lb/>claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm <lb/>weather as in
                    England, and it is as warm here now as it <lb/>was in England in July, although
                    not half so oppressive <lb/>and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the
                        elec<lb break="no"/>tion : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel, most of
                    <lb/>them English. We do not trouble ourselves about poli<lb break="no"/>tics in
                    this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil, <lb/>and to reap the fair
                    reward of our labour. On Saturday <lb/>we were charged 100 dollars each for
                    passage, and four <lb/>dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three
                    <lb/>and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four <lb/>quarters of the
                    best peas, rye, grass seed, and some more <lb/>of Hill's Scots ploughs, to be
                    left at Messrs Brown and <lb/>Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the
                    Illinois. <lb/>Mr Trimmer, an Englishman, has purchased 20,000 acres <lb/>of
                    land near Mr Birkbeck, and has taken twenty couple of <lb/>hounds with him, so
                    that we shall have some hunting as <lb/>well as shooting if we like. It is said
                    that he is about to <lb/>marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he
                    tells <lb/>me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over <lb/>the
                    Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they <lb/>are the only thing
                    wanting there. I should have brought <lb/>over some with me, but they may follow
                    us ; as I under<lb break="no"/>stand the labourers, with the pay of a dollar a
                    day, can <lb/>live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer <lb/>of
                    L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply, and others that I <lb/>have seen from Illinois,
                    report that the farmer can <lb/>get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says
                    there is <lb/>a good sure market, and a fair profit and only one penny <lb/>per
                    acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to <lb/>pay. Price of labour
                    is very dear here ; we pay a dollar <lb/>for washing every dozen of shirts,
                    cravats, pocket handker<lb break="no"/>chiefs, &amp; c. &amp; c. The price of a
                    gallon of best rum is one <lb/>and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my
                    things <lb/>shipped from England, I have paid 92 dollars for. Al<lb break="no"
                    />though I should like England very well if it was not for <lb/>the taxes, yet,
                    from what I have seen hitherto, I like <lb/>America ten times better</p>

                <p>Important Extracts of a Letter from a very Intelligent and re<lb break="no"
                    />spectable Engineer in Louisville, dated January 20. 1819.</p>
                <p>"The best time for coming to America I <lb/>should judge to be in the summer, to
                    land in <lb/>September, so as to be able to get here before <lb/>the weather was
                    too cold. It is safe to <lb/>settle in the beginning of winter or spring, so as
                    <lb/>to inure to the climate by degrees. The best <lb/>plan for coming is to
                    take a part of the steerage <lb/>of a vessel, and find your own provisions; you
                    <lb/>will save more in this way, over a cabin passage, <lb/>than would buy a
                    decent farm here. The lands <lb/>in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and
                    <lb/>one of corn alternately, and improve ; dung is <lb/>never applied, and is
                    said to be hurtful. It is <lb/>without question what the land here is as good as
                    <lb/>can be, and when to this is added the heat of <lb/>the summer, one ought to
                    be able to raise crops <lb/>as heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10
                    <lb/>dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not <lb/>cleared, all the
                    trees under 12 inches are cut <lb/>down and burned on the ground, and the large
                    <lb/>ones are killed by cutting round the bark. The <lb/>ground is then prepared
                    for Indian corn by <lb/>scratching it with a hoe, or a kind of shuffle,
                    <lb/>which, from the looseness and mellowness of the <lb/>soil, is easily done,
                    and in this way sixty or <lb/>eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised.
                    &#x2013; <lb/>the trees die in a few months, and in three or <lb/>four years
                    fall down one by one, and the roots <lb/>will rot out in seven or eight years.
                    It is a <lb/>great want of sense in any new settler not to <lb/>adopt the modes
                    of this country, proven to be the <lb/>best adapted to the state of it by 200
                    years ex<lb break="no"/>perience. The Americans, of all other people I <lb/>know
                    of, are the most ingenious in adapting the <lb/>means to the end. I do not know
                    if they have <lb/>more sense than other nations, but they certain<lb break="no"
                    />ly make it go farther. Every tools answers the <lb/>purpose most effectually.
                    This is evident in their <lb/>axes. An American will cut down three times
                    <lb/>more trees and square three times more timber <lb/>than the best of your
                    wrights could do, and not <lb/>by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is
                    <lb/>with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down <lb/>four acres of wheat in
                    a day, what what he calls <lb/>a cradle scythe, and lay it as refular for
                        bind<lb break="no"/>ing as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian <lb/>corn
                    is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels <lb/>of wheat is about the average
                    of an acre. It is <lb/>easier farming here than with you on sundry ac<lb
                        break="no"/>counts ; the soil is free, few weeds make their <lb/>appearance,
                    and when ploughed down are cer<lb break="no"/>tainly killed by the hot sun.
                    There are no frosts <lb/>to injure the crop, and no wet weather to de<lb
                        break="no"/>stroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days, <lb/>and grain is
                    cut one day and stacked or housed <lb/>the next. From the shortness and mildness
                    of <lb/>the winter, little provender is needed for the <lb/>stock. Swine are
                    raised at no expence. They <lb/>breed and feed in the woods, and only want from
                    <lb/>one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing, <lb/>when they sell for
                    five cents a lb. In the less <lb/>settled parts of the country, it is the
                    practise to <lb/>give all the corn to swine and then send them to <lb/>market. A
                    bushel of corn is equal in nutriment <lb/>to a bushel of wheat for man or
                    beast.</p>

                <p><pb/>The brig Henry sailed from Cork on Wednes<lb break="no"/>day se'ennight,
                    with about two hundred passen<lb break="no"/>gers for Aux Cayes, to join Sir
                    Gregor M'Gre<lb break="no"/>gor, who lately landed on the Spanish Main with
                    <lb/>a small force. General M'Gregor, it seems, left <lb/>authority with Colonel
                    Eyre to recruit men for <lb/>his service, and to ship them as he best could.
                    &#x2013; <lb/>There are a number of idle gentlemen about <lb/>Dublin at present,
                    and also many in the country, <lb/>who have been captivated with the speculation
                    of <lb/>embarking in the Patriotic cause, and for some <lb/>time they have
                    appeared in the streets in fanci<lb break="no"/>ful uniforms. We understand that
                    Col. Eyre has <lb/>formed a Committee, who treat with such young <lb/>gentlemen
                    as have the inclination to proceed on <lb/>the enterprise, and have money to pay
                    for such <lb/>rank as they may wish to possess under M'Gre<lb break="no"/>gor.
                    The money thus furnished is made a stock <lb/>purse to pay the freight of the
                    vessel, and hence <lb/>it is necessary that the greater part of the adven<lb
                        break="no"/>turers should be <hi rend="italic">officers </hi>; for those who
                    are con<lb break="no"/>tented with the humble station of privates are <lb/>not
                    required to contribute and their passage, <lb/>subsistence, &amp;c. must be
                    defrayed by the com<lb break="no"/>mon fund. Mr D'Evereaux, from the county
                    <lb/>of Wexford, is also raising men for the same <lb/>service, but under
                    different circumstances. He <lb/>professes to have authority from General Bo<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>livar to grant commissions, and to ship the men <lb/>he may raise for
                    head-quarters in Venezuela. Mr <lb/>D'Evereaux has not yet dispatched any men,
                    and <lb/>Col. Eyre has certainly shewn more activity in <lb/>this respect.

                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>Advices have been received again from the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope of 6th March,
                    which are several days later <lb/>than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of
                    the <lb/>Caffres there remains no doubt, although it does <lb/>not appear that
                    Government have as yet received of<lb break="no"/>ficial information regarding
                    it. The private accounts <lb/>state that two valuable officers had lost their
                    lives, and <lb/>also a great number of men. The Governor himself <lb/>in order
                    by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caf<lb break="no"/>fres, had, with a
                    competent force, proceeded to the in<lb break="no"/>terior. Great inconvenience
                    was experienced for the <lb/>want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not
                    this <lb/>been the case, it was believed that in a very few days
                    <lb/>tranquility would have been restored.</p>
                <p>We are sorry to state that another hurricane has ta<lb break="no"/>ken place in
                    the Isle of France ; it commenced on the <lb/>25th January, and has done great
                    mischief to the ship<lb break="no"/>ping, and also to the plantations of that
                    ill-fated Is<lb break="no"/>land.</p>
                <p>A Dutch mail has arrived, with papers to the 19th <lb/>inst. At Batavia, two of
                    the leaders of the late distur<lb break="no"/>bances have been tried and
                    execute, and that degree <lb/>of tranquility which terror produces has been
                    restored. <lb/>In the administration of their colonies in the east, the
                    <lb/>conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and op<lb break="no"/>pressive ;
                    and it is to be regretted that the extensive <lb/>and fertile island of Java
                    should have been surrendered <lb/>to their rapacity. During the short time that
                    it was in <lb/>possession of this country, various important improve<lb
                        break="no"/>ments were introduced into its domestic administration ;
                    <lb/>the practise of torture, according to the humane and <lb/>enlightened
                    maxims of British jurisprudence, was abo<lb break="no"/>lished ; new and better
                    modes of collecting the revenue <lb/>were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and
                    of regard <lb/>for the interests of all the various classes of which the
                    <lb/>population is composed, was evinced, which made the <lb/>British Government
                    highly popular.</p>
                <p>Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants <lb/>for the safety of the
                    Queen Charlotte, Jamaica packet. <lb/>She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March,
                    and had a <lb/>great quantity of specie on board. No things have <lb/>since been
                    received of her. Several vessels sailed since <lb/>her departure, and have
                    arrived safe. The Ocean quit<lb break="no"/>ted Jamaica on the 6th of April, and
                    arrived here se<lb break="no"/>veral days since.</p>
                <p>Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thurs<lb break="no"/>day from Jamaica,
                    bring Port Royal Papers to the <lb/>25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived
                    at <lb/>Kingston, from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regi<lb break="no"/>ment
                    was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be dis<lb break="no"/>banded.</p>

                    general good <lb/>of the whole, until fortune shall so far favour <lb/>their
                    efforts as to enable them to become inde<lb break="no"/>pendent of each other.
                    By this means much less <lb/>than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birk<lb
                        break="no"/>beck as the proper stock for an emigrant to be<lb break="no"
                    />gin with, will be sufficient ; and thus a new im<lb break="no"/>petus will be
                    given to that tide of huma beings <lb/>which is constantly flowing towards the
                    new <lb/>world. Would it not be policy to give encou<lb break="no"/>ragement to
                    these industrious swarms to settle in <lb/>our own colonies? We have heard with
                    some <lb/>pleasure in rumour that several parishes have <lb/>taken into their
                    serious consideration the pru<lb break="no"/>dence of establishing a fund for
                    the encourage<lb break="no"/>ment of those poor persons who may be dispo<lb
                        break="no"/>ed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; <lb/>in furtherance
                    of which laudable design, an ap<lb break="no"/>plication is to be made to
                    Government for grants <lb/>of land in desirable siutations, especially in Up<lb
                        break="no"/>per Canada, where the climate is described to be <lb/>of the
                    finest description. There is no doubt that <lb/>many who are now pining in
                    workhouses would <lb/>gladly accept of such an alternative, and who,
                    <lb/>instead of being, as at present, a burthen to them<lb break="no"/>selves
                    and to society, would, by their exertions, <lb/>be adding to the importance and
                    stability of our <lb/>possessions in that quarter, as well as open<lb break="no"
                    />ing a new source for the consumption of our ma<lb break="no"/>nufactures.</p>

                </p>
                <p>"English Prairie, (Illinoia,) Nov.25. 1818.</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi> &#x2013; Your favour of 15th June is before me.
                    <lb/>Presuming you retain a copy of the queries, I <lb/>proceed to answer then
                    in order: &#x2013; Respecting <lb/>domestic servants ; what may be the condition
                    of <lb/>our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee, <lb/>but should it
                    be in your power to bring with you <lb/>female domestics, it would be well to do
                    so ; also <lb/>a carpenter or two and a few labourers ; if with <lb/>families,
                    so much the better. Written engage<lb break="no"/>ments for a term, or
                    indentures, are not binding, <lb/>unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I
                    <lb/>have not seen any of these documents, and can <lb/>therefore give you no
                    precise directions for them : <lb/>perhaps a simple engagement from the parties,
                    <lb/>acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred <lb/>in bringing our, might be
                    a sufficient security, <lb/>leaving their wages to be determined here ac<lb
                        break="no"/>cording to the current rates, yet to be establish<lb break="no"
                    />ed by the proportion of supply to the demand, <lb/>which, as I remarked above,
                    it is now impossible <lb/>to ascertain. As to the number of labourers, or
                    <lb/>female domestics, you would need perhaps six of <lb/>the former and two of
                    the latter would a safe <lb/>adventure, looking to the colony for an ad<lb
                        break="no"/>dition, should you need it, after you are set<lb break="no"
                    />tled &#x2013; before that you will find a greater num<lb break="no"/>ber an
                    incumbrance : this is, I think, all I <lb/>can say to your first, third, fourth,
                    and fifth <lb/>queries. All expence of transfer of your fami<lb break="no"/>ly
                    and luggage, supposing the latter to weigh <lb/>ten thousand pounds, I should
                    estimate under <lb/>L.1000 sterling. On this particular subject Mr R. Flower
                    <lb/>would give you most particular information &#x2013; <lb/>The luggage would
                    cost about ten dollars per <lb/>100 lbs. So much for your query. To the se<lb
                        break="no"/>venth query &#x2013; I think L.200 would assist your <lb/>family
                    in plenty for a year, exclusive of wages <lb/>and clothing. Eighth query
                    &#x2013; L.3000 would be <lb/>a good capital for a section, or 640 acres, and I
                    <lb/>question your wishing to hold in cultivation a <lb/>larger tract. Ninth
                    query &#x2013; I consider our si<lb break="no"/>tuation not liable to future
                    disturbance from In<lb break="no"/>dians, in the event of a war between Great
                        Bri<lb break="no"/>tain and the United States, being covered by in<lb
                        break="no"/>creasing settlements to the west, north-west, and <lb/>north.
                    Tenth query &#x2013; The earthquakes men<lb break="no"/>tioned by Bradbury I
                    have heard of from many <lb/>persons ; but I have not discovered that it has
                    <lb/>left any impression on the public mind ; on this <lb/>score, for my own
                    part, I feel no anxiety about <lb/>the matter ; Great Britain, I suppose, in
                        propor<lb break="no"/>tion to its dimensions, is equally liable to earth<lb
                        break="no"/>quakes. Elenventh query, &#x2013; The route by New Or<lb
                        break="no"/>leans will, I have no doubt, be preferable to that <lb/>by the
                    eastern cities. When due precaution <lb/>against the diseases of the climate are
                    observed, <lb/>I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth <lb/>query &#x2013;
                    The health of my family has not suffered <lb/>from the climate. One of my sons
                    has been <lb/>affected with ague. This summer has been <lb/>more sickly in these
                    parts than any season for <lb/>seven years past, and has afforded me a most
                        en<lb break="no"/>couraging confirmation of the temperature and
                    <lb/>salubrity of our settlement, and has also afforded <lb/>immeasurable proofs
                    of those facts regarding the <lb/>sufferings of new settlers, to which I have so
                    <lb/>anxiously invited the attention of the readers of <lb/>my journal. On the
                    whole, provided common <lb/>sense should be seconded by common industry, <lb/>in
                    the inclosure and cultivation of our colony, I <lb/>think we shall not be
                    visisted by more than our <lb/>due share of physical calamity. I deferred no<lb
                        break="no"/>ticing your second query, the subect being con<lb break="no"
                    />nected with the proposal respecting land, at the <lb/>conclusion of your
                    letter. I would strongly re<lb break="no"/>commend your deferring the purchase
                    of land <lb/>until your arrival. It would be difficult to con<lb break="no"/>vey
                    to you the reasons, but you would feel the <lb/>propriety of my advice, should
                    you come. I <lb/>think you would have as good a choice two <lb/>years hence as
                    now, because excellent siutations, <lb/>as yet unsurveyed, will then be on sale.
                    I have <lb/>no eligible offer to make you beyond a section. <lb/>You inquire
                    concerning venomous reptiles ; they <lb/>are no source of injury or alarm to us.
                    Insects, <lb/>in new countries, often abound to an astonishing <lb/>degree, and
                    are sufficiently teazing to man and <lb/>beast. Many species yield instantly to
                        cultiva<lb break="no"/>tion, and are heard of no more as plagues ;
                    <lb/>others will continue until conquered by order <lb/>and industry. The
                    thermometer ranges from <lb/>13 below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are, of
                    <lb/>course, of rare occurence, and short duration. <lb/>At Philadelphia, I
                    understand, it rose this sum<lb break="no"/>mer 97, and in this neighbourhood,
                    in the low <lb/>river bottoms, I believe it might reach that de<lb break="no"
                    />gree. On our praire I think it never reached <lb/>89. The smaller streams are
                    rapid and soon <lb/>dry ; the larger sluggish in the extreme &#x2013; cat<lb
                        break="no"/>fish, perch, sturgeons abound, and many others <lb/>I believe. I
                    think 1000 dollars would build a <lb/>comfortable plain dwelling. &#x2013; Your
                    obedient ser<lb break="no"/>vant, <hi rend="smallcaps">M. Birkbeck</hi>."</p>

                    <lb/>that the family does not consist of more than one man, <lb/>one woman, and
                    two children under 14 years of age. All <lb/>children above the number of two
                    will have to be paid for, <lb/>in addition to the deposit above mentioned, in
                    the propor<lb break="no"/>tion of L.5 for every two children under 14 years of
                    age <lb/>and L.5 for every person between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
                <p>In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be pro<lb break="no"/>vided at
                    the expence of Government for the settlers, who <lb/>shall also be victualled
                    from the time of their embarka<lb break="no"/>tion until the time of their
                    landing in the colony.</p>
                <p>A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter speci<lb break="no"/>fied, be
                    made to him at the rate of 100 acres for every <lb/>such person or family whom
                    he shall so take our ; one-third <lb/>of the sum advanced to Government on the
                    outset shall <lb/>be repaid on landing, when the victualling at the expence</p>
                <p><pb/>of Government shall cease. A further proportion of one<lb break="no"/> third
                    shall be repaid, as soon as it shall be certified to the <lb/>Governor of the
                    colony that the settlers under the direc<lb break="no"/>tion of the person
                    taking them out are actually located <lb/>upon the land assigned to them ; and
                    the remainer at <lb/>the expiration of three months from the date of their lo<lb

                <p>If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy <lb/>of population shall unite
                    in selecting an intelligent indivi<lb break="no"/>dual to proceed to the Cape,
                    with settlers under his direc<lb break="no"/>tion, not less in number and of the
                    description above<lb break="no"/> mentioned, and shall advance money in the
                    proportion <lb/>above-mentioned, the Government will grant land to such <lb/>an
                    individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a fa<lb break="no"/>mily,
                    leaving the parish at liverty to make such conditions <lb/>with the individual,
                    or the settlers, as may be calculated <lb/>to prevent the parish becoming again
                    chargeable with the <lb/>maintenance of such settlers, in the event of their
                    return <lb/>to this country.</p>
                <p>But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless it <lb/>shall be clear that
                    the persons proposin to become settlers <lb/>shall have distinctly given their
                    consent, and the head of <lb/>each family is not infirm or incapable of
                    work.</p>
                <p>It is further proposed, that in any case in which one <lb/>hundred families
                    proceed together, and apply for leave to <lb/>carry out with them a minister of
                    their own persuasion, <lb/>Government will, upon their being actually located,
                        as<lb break="no"/>sign a salary to the minister who they have may have
                    <lb/>selected to accompany them, if he shall be approved by <lb/>the Secretary
                    of State.</p>
                <p>The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed, <lb/>which rent, however,
                    will be remitted for the first ten <lb/>years ; and at the expiration of three
                    years (during which <lb/>the party and a number of families, in the proportion
                    of <lb/>one for every 100 acres, must have resided on the estate), <lb/>the land
                    shall be measured at the expence of Government, <lb/>and the holder shall
                    obtain, without fee, his title thereto, <lb/>on a perpetual quit rent, not
                    exceeding in any case L. 2 <lb/>sterling for every 100 acres ; subject, however
                    to this <lb/>clause beyond the usual reservations"&#x2013;that the land shall
                    <lb/>become foreited to Government, in case the party shall <lb/>abandon the
                    estate, or not bring it into cultivation within <lb/>a given number of years. I
                    am <lb/>Your most obedient humble servant. <lb/>* The usual reservations are the
                    right of the Crown to mines <lb/>of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to
                    make such roads <lb/>as may be necessary for the convenience of the colony.</p>

                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>A letter from Corfu, dated the 10th ult. states that <lb/>the Governor of the
                    Ionian Islands, General Mait<lb break="no"/>land, embarked on the 8th inst. for
                    Rome, in order to <lb/>negotitate a Concordat relative to the Romish Clergy
                    <lb/>of the United Islands, as it appeared that Lord Guild<lb break="no"/>ford,
                    who had been charged with the affair by the <lb/>Prince Regent, had failed in
                    his negotiation to that <lb/>effect.</p>
                <p>Previously to the departure of the Governor, a de<lb break="no"/>putation from
                    the Parguinotes emigrants waited upon <lb/>him, to claim the sum to be paid by
                    Ali Pacha, for <lb/>property left in Parga, agreeably to stipulation. Ge<lb
                        break="no"/>neral Maitland assured them he would not depart with<lb
                        break="no"/>out adopting measures in their favour, and immediate<lb
                        break="no"/>ly issued a proclamation, appointing a commission of
                    <lb/>payment. Sir Frederick Adam fills the office of High <lb/>Commissioner, <hi
                        rend="italic">ad interim</hi>, during the absence of the <lb/>Governor.</p>
                <p>Advices from Demerara are received to the 3d ult. <lb/>The following is from the
                    Guiana Chronicle of the <lb/>24th May:&#x2013;" We observe by St Vincent:
                    papers, <lb/>which we have just received, that the Royal York Ran<lb break="no"
                    />gers, under the command of Colonel Smelt, had em<lb break="no"/>barked on
                    board the Diadem and Elizabeth transports <lb/>for Canada, where the regiment is
                    intended to be dis<lb break="no"/>banded. It is stated that each of the men will
                    have a <lb/>certain portion of land allotted them in that province <lb/>for
                    cultivation and their future support.</p>
                <p>We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d <lb/>ult by which we learn that
                    in the Court of Session, on <lb/>the 18th idem, Capt. Redman, of the brig San
                        Do<lb break="no"/>mingo, from Ross, was ordered to pay a fine of 10l.
                    <lb/>each, for 20 passengers brought in that vessel over and <lb/>above the
                    number allowed by act of Parliament; and a <lb/>further sum of 10l. for not
                    having the regulations re<lb break="no"/>specting passengers posted up in some
                    conspicuous part <lb/>of the vessel ; making in all a fine of 210l.</p>
                <p>We subjoin an extract from the Montreal Herald of <lb/>the 12th June, relative to
                    Mr Gourlay, the celebrated <lb/>reformer:</p>
                <p>From the Niagara Spectator, of the 27th May, <lb/>we find the far famed champion
                    of civil liberty, Mr <lb/>Gourlay, has again made his debut in an address to
                    <lb/>the resident landowners of Upper Canada. This pro<lb break="no"/>duction is
                    of the same stamp as him other lucubrations, <lb/>abounding with strong and
                    vigorous assertions in place <lb/>of facts&#x2013;a well wove sophistry to
                    beguile the super<lb break="no"/>ficial reader ; and some of the most egregious
                    errors in <lb/>colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well
                    <lb/>calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dis<lb break="no"/>sent
                    from the political proceeding of this reformer, it <lb/>would be deemed
                    intrusive by many of our readers to <lb/>enter into a refutation of the tenets,
                    or an exposure of <lb/>the absurdities, contained in his address. By others
                    <lb/>we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. <lb/>Both
                    imputations we utterly disclaim ; while, as men <lb/>we regret that the mad
                    career pursued by Mr Gourlay has <lb/>deprived society of the benefits which
                    might have been <lb/>reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless
                    <lb/>has a share), we must, as good subjects, feel happy <lb/>that his career
                    has been checked without any bad con<lb break="no"/>sequences to society.</p>
                <p>The following is the present distribution of the for<lb break="no"/>ces in the
                    West Indies:&#x2013; <lb/>2d Regiment (or Queen's) &#x2013;Demerara. <lb/>4th

                    <lb/>to them, those which may prove, upon examination, to <lb/>be most
                    eligible.</p>
                <p>"In order to give some security to the Government, <lb/>that the persons
                    undertaking to make these establish<lb break="no"/>ments have the means of doing
                    so, every person engag<lb break="no"/>ing to take out the above-mentioned number
                    of per<lb break="no"/>sons or families, shall deposit, at the rate of 10l. (to
                    be <lb/>repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every family so <lb/>taken out,
                    provided that the family does not consist of <lb/>more than one man, one woman,
                    and two children un<lb break="no"/>der 14 years of age. All children ahove the
                    number <lb/>of two must be paid for, in addition to the deposit
                    <lb/>above-mentioned, in the proportion of 5l. for every per<lb break="no"/>son
                    between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
                <p>"In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be <lb/>provided at the
                    expence of Government for the settlers, <lb/>who shall be victualled from the
                    time of their em<lb break="no"/>barkation until the time of their landing in the
                    Colony.</p>
                <p>"A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter spe<lb break="no"/>cified, shall
                    be made to him, at the rate of 100 acres <lb/>for every such person or family
                    whom he so takes out ; <lb/>one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the
                    <lb/>outset, shall be repaid on landing, when the victuall<lb break="no"/>ing at
                    the expense of the Government shall cease. A fur<lb break="no"/>ther proportion
                    of one-third shall be repaid, as soon as <lb/>it shall be certified to the
                    Governor of the Colony that <lb/>the settlers, under the direction of the person
                    taking <lb/>them out, are actually located upon the lands assigned to <lb/>them
                    ; and the remainder at the expiration of three <lb/>months from the date of
                    their location.</p>
                <p>"If any parishes in which there may be a redun<lb break="no"/>dancy of
                    population, shall unite in selecting an intelli<lb break="no"/>gent individual
                    to proceed to the Cape, with settlers <lb/>under his direction, not less in
                    number and of the des<lb break="no"/>cription above-mentioned, and shall advance
                    money in <lb/>the proportion above-mentioned, the Government will <lb/>grant
                    land to such an individual at the rate of 100 <lb/>acres for every head of a
                    family, leaving the parish at <lb/>liberty to make such conditions with the
                    individual, <lb/>or the settlers, as may be calculated to prevent the pa<lb
                        break="no"/>rish becoming again chargeable with the maintenance <lb/>of such
                    settlers, in the event of their return to this <lb/>country.</p>
                <p>"But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless <lb/>it shall be clear that
                    the persons proposing to become <lb/>settlers shall have distinctly given their
                    consent, and <lb/>that the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of
                    <lb/>work.</p>
                <p>"It is further proposed, that in any case in which <lb/>one hundred families
                    proceed together, and apply for <lb/>leave to carry out with them a minister of
                    their own <lb/>persuasion, Government will, upon their being actually
                    <lb/>located, assign a salary to the minister whom they may <lb/>have selected
                    to accompany them, if he shall be ap<lb break="no"/>proved by the Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>"The lands will be granted at a quit rent, to be fix<lb break="no"/>ed, which
                    rent, however, will be remitted for the first <lb/>10 years ; and at the
                    expiration of three years (during <lb/>which the party, and a number of
                    families, in the pro<lb break="no"/>portion of 1 for every 100 acres, must have
                    resided on <lb/>the estate) the land shall be measured at the expense <lb/>of
                    Government and the holder shall obtain, without <lb/>fee, his title thereto, on
                    a perpetual quit rent, not ex<lb break="no"/>ceeding[?] in any case of 2l.
                    sterling for every 100 acres <lb/>subject, however to this clause[?] beyond the
                    usual re<lb break="no"/>servations*&#x2013;that the land shall become forfeited
                    to <lb/>Government, in case the party shall abandone the es<lb break="no"/>tate,
                    or not bring it into the cultivator within a given <lb/>number of years. I am,
                    <lb/>"Your most obedient servant."</p>
                <p>* The usual reservations are the right of the Crown <lb/>to mines of precious
                    stones, of gold and silver, and to <lb/>make such roads as may be necessary for
                    the conveni<lb break="no"/>ence of the Colony.</p>
                <p>There are already three extensive settlements on the <lb/>South East Coast of
                    Africa, where the finest wheat is <lb/>produced, with little labour, namely
                    Algoa Bay, St. <lb/>Catherine's Bay, and the new settlement on the Kny<lb
                        break="no"/>sua, a considerable river, which is navigable for large
                    <lb/>vessels to the Northward. There are also extensive <lb/>and fertile lands
                    towards Saldanha Bay. As the pro<lb break="no"/>duce from the new colonists will
                    consist of grain and <lb/>as the markets of the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of
                    <lb/>France, Brazils &amp;c. will in all probability be soon <lb/>overstocked,
                    the settlers will look to the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try for a market, when
                    an unfavourable harvest renders <lb/>the import necessary ; and in anticipation
                    of this event, <lb/>the merchants interested in the Cape trade intend, we
                    <lb/>understand, to make an application to Government <lb/>respecting the Corn
                    Laws, to put the corn from the <lb/>Cape of Good Hope on the same footing as
                    grain from <lb/>the British North American colonies.</p>

                <p>The accounts received on Tuesday from the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope are to the 17th
                    April, which are consi<lb break="no"/>derably later than those previously
                    received.</p>
                <p>Information has just reached Cape Town, that a <lb/>detachment of troops, joined
                    by a number of the inha<lb break="no"/>bitants, who had been sent to suppress
                    the Caffres, had <lb/>succeeded in driving them back, and were compelled to
                    <lb/>cross the river. The corn districts were in a great <lb/>measure cleared of
                    the savages, and the country-people <lb/>were returning to their homes, where
                    they considered <lb/>themselves secure from any further attacks, at least for
                    <lb/>some time to come.</p>
                <p>Letters have just been received, via Calcutta, from <lb/>New South Walves, up to
                    the end of November. The <lb/>colony was then all well, and several
                    convict-ships (the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Marley, Glory, Mario, Isabella,</hi>
                    and others) had ar<lb break="no"/>rived, having made the passage out direct in
                    the short <lb/>period of three months and twenty days, and landed <lb/>all their
                    convicts and passengers in good health. This <lb/>may be considered as another,
                    among many proofs, that <lb/>it is unnecessary to make any stay at any
                    intermediate <lb/>port.</p>

                <p>"It is with the deepest regret I inform you, that <lb/>notwithstanding the
                    liberality of Great Britain, and the <lb/>faith of treaties solemnly entered
                    into, this coast swarms <lb/>with slave vessels, drugging thousands of its
                    miserable <lb/>inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago <lb/>arrived
                    here the Union, of Liverpool : the supercargo <lb/>states, that during his stay
                    in the River Calaba, not less <lb/>than eight vessels, averaging 500 slaves
                    each, had sail<lb break="no"/>ed for the Spanish Collective."</p>

                </p>
                <p>"We learn there are about 70 souls, mostly Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, preparing
                    to set out from this place, the 25th <lb/>inst. for Lord Selkirk's settlement on
                    the River Rouge. <lb/>The number of settlers there at this time, it is said
                    <lb/>amount to about 590. An intelligent Canadian, in <lb/>easy circumstances
                    with whom we conversed, and who <lb/>goes thither with the before-mentioned
                    settlers, with <lb/>all his family, says he passed a winter there when en<lb

                    <lb/>country, and the climate much milder than that of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada.
                    Thus, there is every appearance, that this Co<lb break="no"/>lony, in the course
                    of time, will become populous and <lb/>flourishing."</p>

                </p>
                <p>We are sorry to state that another most distressing <lb/>and calamitous fire has
                    taken place at St. John's New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Captain Critchelly, of
                    the alliance, arriv-[?] <lb/>ed at Liverpool from Carbonear, in Newfoundland,
                    [?] <lb/>which he left on the 22d ult. states that a fire broke <lb/>out in an
                    uninhabited house in St. John's between one <lb/>and two o'clock in the morning
                    of the 18th of June <lb/>and that from the inflammable nature of the house[?]
                    <lb/>and more particularly of their roofs, it spread with such <lb/>rapidity,
                    that in the short space of three hours 170 fa-[?] <lb/>milies were burnt out,
                    besides an immense quantity <lb/>of produce consumed in various stores and
                        ware<lb break="no"/>houses.</p>
                <p>We learn from another account, that the fire destroy<lb break="no"/>ed the whole
                    of the old part of the town. It broke out <lb/>near Conder and Tracy's store,
                    and burnt all between <lb/>that and Messrs Baine, Johnson and Co.'s.</p>

                </p>
                <p>At the present moment, under the prospect of emi<lb break="no"/>gration, all
                    intelligence coming from this quarter is of <lb/>peculiar interest. The letters
                    which reached town [?] <lb/>Tuesday, mention that the Caffres had commenced [?]
                    <lb/>tilities anew, and that their numbers were very consi<lb break="no"
                    />derable.</p>
                <p>Cape Town, May 5. <lb/>The Caffres have broken out, and a very serious war
                    <lb/>is carried on at present on the borders. It is said <lb/>that the savages
                    are to the amount of 50,000, and a de<lb break="no"/>tachment of 6000 attacked
                    Graham's Town on Satur<lb break="no"/>day week, about 12 o'clock in the day, but
                    were re<lb break="no"/>pulsed, and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried
                    <lb/>off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every <lb/>district of the
                    colony for the young boors to inrol them<lb break="no"/>selves to oppose the
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>Cape Town, May 16. <lb/>The 13th regiment, commanded by Colonel Wil<lb break="no"
                    />shire have come up with the main body of Caf<lb break="no"/>fres, near
                    Graham's Town and have defeated them with <lb/>great loss. Since then they have
                    withdrawn from the <lb/>British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at [?]
                    <lb/>place a few days ago from England and have since[?] <lb/>marched off for
                    the frontiers. A large number of in<lb break="no"/>fantry have been mounted on
                    horseback to [?] <lb/>them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are
                    <lb/>all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present <lb/>Governor is
                    going home, and that another has been ap<lb break="no"/>pointed.</p>
                <p>Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us, <lb/>which confirms the sad
                    accounts of the miserable fate of <lb/>the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor.
                    It appears <lb/>that the schooner Marsha[?] had brought accounts from <lb/>San
                    Blas[?], that M'Gregor, after his disgraceful flight <lb/>from Porto Bello,
                    proceeded[?] in the brig Hero, for St. <lb/>Andreas, where he arrived on the 7th
                    of May, and left <lb/>on the 12th, having suffered considerably from the ef<lb
                        break="no"/>fects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had <lb/>been
                    betrayed by some of his Officers, who had [?] <lb/>Porto Bello ; but added he
                    would soon receive rein<lb break="no"/>forcements from England, when he would
                    retake it.</p>
                <p>The Blossom arrived on Sunday from the South A<lb break="no"/>merican station,
                    last from Rio Janeiro, whence she <lb/>sailed on the 8th of June. She landed
                    about two mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars at Rio Janeiro, from Litna[?] and
                    brought <lb/>to England about 140,000 on merchants' account. She, <lb/>and the
                    Andromache, Captain Shirreff, having [?] <lb/>treasure on board, passed Lord
                    Cochrane's squadron, <lb/>in the South Seas, but his Lordship did not discover
                    <lb/>even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the <lb/>ships. His
                    Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent <lb/>order ; and it is but justice to
                    his Lordship to state, <lb/>that he has not resorted to any undue or improper
                    <lb/>means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every <lb/>instance of
                    complaint made to him by the mas<lb break="no"/>ters of merchant shipping, of
                    any of their crew having <lb/>deserted to him, he ordered the men to be again
                        in<lb break="no"/>stantly sent on board their respective ships.</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to the Cape of Good <lb/>Hope. <lb/>(From
                        Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to <lb/>Parliament the expediency
                    of voting t50,000 towards <lb/>the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of
                    Good <lb/>Hope. Let it be remembered, once for all, that it is <lb/>not because
                    that colony is too thin of inhabitants, but <lb/>that the mother country is too
                    full, that this plan is sug<lb break="no"/>gested. The question is not how you
                    maintain <lb/>a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth, <lb/>but,
                    whether you will stop emigration to the frozen <lb/>shores of Canada, and to the
                    United States, or divert <lb/>and encourage it to the finest colony in the world
                    &#x2013; <lb/>We surely have learnt enough of North America to <lb/>convince us
                    of the degraded and miserable conditions of <lb/>its people. South African, on
                    the other hand, has every <lb/>advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the
                    land of <lb/>our forefathers.</p>
                <p>The more fully to understand and appreciate these <lb/>advantages, we shall set
                    before our readers a short view <lb/>of the conditions and facilities of the
                    colony in ques<lb break="no"/>tion.</p>
                <p>The spring, from September to December, is the <lb/>most agreedable season. The
                    summer, from December <lb/>to March, is often intensely hot. The autumn, from
                    <lb/>March to June, is generally fine and pleasant. The <lb/>winter is rainy and
                    stormy, and for the most part so <lb/>cold as to make fires very comfortable
                    during the <lb/>months of July, August, and September. Most of the <lb/>diseases
                    that appear among the natives proceed rather <lb/>from their gross and indolent
                    modes of living, than the <lb/>unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of
                    water in <lb/>summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want <lb/>of
                    industry or materials this defect is not remedied, as <lb/>it is in India, by
                    artificial tanks or reservoirs. When<lb break="no"/>ever, however, irrigation
                    can be employed, either from <lb/>wells or rivers, the most abundant vegetation
                    ensues. <lb/>Good and abundant water has always been found by <lb/>digging wells
                    in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the <lb/>whole colony there is scarcely a
                    river that can be called <lb/>navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the
                    <lb/>winter, most of them dry up during the summer. All <lb/>the rivers are well
                    stocked with perch, eels and small <lb/>turtle ; and with a certain distance
                    from the coast <lb/>they abound with the several fish peculiar to these
                    seas.</p>
                <p>There is general want of wood in South Africa &#x2013; <lb/>At the distance,
                    however, of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay <lb/>there is a large forest of a many
                    thousand acres. Some <lb/>of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing
                    <lb/>size of 10 feet in diameter, and to the height of 30 or <lb/>40 feet of
                    trunk clear of branches. The wood is use<lb break="no"/>ful for many purposes,
                    but will not bear exposure to <lb/>weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3
                    feet <lb/>in diameter and the trunk straight and very high &#x2013; <lb/>The
                    Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree...</p>
                <p>The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe, <lb/>and to what perfection the
                    other wines of the colony <lb/>are capable of being brought, may very fairly be
                        au<lb break="no"/>gured for the great improvement that has already ta<lb
                        break="no"/>ken place in its manufacture. Heretofore, the Dutch <lb/>farmer
                    and the merchant have regarded more the quan<lb break="no"/>tity than the
                    quality of their wine. And when a car<lb break="no"/>go was once shipped, it
                    mattered little to them, whe<lb break="no"/>ther sound or sour it reached its
                    destination. Little <lb/>care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches
                    <lb/>were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decay<lb break="no"/>ed and
                    unripe grapes, stalks and leaves, were all pro<lb break="no"/>miscuously thrown
                    in the wine-press. The mode <lb/>also of seasoning the casks with brimstone, and
                    the <lb/>want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets, have <lb/>all
                    contributed to deteriorate the character and confine <lb/>the sale of Cape
                    Madeira. These defects have lately <lb/>been in a great measure remedied. Proper
                    persons <lb/>have been sent out from Madeira and this country, and <lb/>every
                    care seems now taken to meet and secure the <lb/>growing demand in European
                    markets. The trifling <lb/>duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country, has
                    been <lb/>the means of introducing it into many families, which <lb/>have
                    hitherto used home-made wines. And though the <lb/>merchants at Madeira have
                    made many remonstrances <lb/>on this preference, it surely is but equitable that
                        en<lb break="no"/>couragement should be given to the stape export of a
                    <lb/>colony, now decidely, and we must trust unalterably, Eng<lb break="no"
                    />lish. But in addition to wines there are other articles <lb/>of colonial
                    growth, exported to the East Indies, Eu<lb break="no"/>rope, and America. Grain,
                    wool, bides, and skins, <cb/>
                    <lb/>whale oil and bone, dried fruits, salt provisions, soap <lb/>and candles,
                    aloes, tobacco. Such are the articles of <lb/>commerce that might be turned to
                    the best account. &#x2013; <lb/>But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will
                        con<lb break="no"/>tinue to thrive in this colony, under the present mode
                    <lb/>of administering its government and laws. It has been <lb/>said, that
                    despotism would be the best of governments <lb/>were the despot virtuous. This
                    may be ; but conti<lb break="no"/>tuted as human nature is, we fear that the
                    purest a<lb break="no"/>mongst us needs some control. Control, however,
                    <lb/>there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes <lb/>and annuls laws
                    at pleasure. He inserts a proclama<lb break="no"/>tion in the Cape Gazette, and
                    from that moment <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">fiat</hi> becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an
                    <lb/>adviser in the colonial secretary, whose influence does <lb/>not extend
                    beyond that of mere advice. Strange to <lb/>add, the laws at the Cape are at
                    this moment Dutch <lb/>laws, rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the
                    <lb/>different governors of the colony. All pleadings are <lb/>in writing, and
                    were, till laterly, carried on, <hi rend="italic">foribus</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">clausis</hi>. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and
                    <lb/>civil cases was established, over both of which the go<lb break="no"
                    />vernor presides. In India, in the West Indies, and in <lb/>Canada, there is a
                    governor and a council. These act <lb/>as checks upon each other. But at the
                    Cape there is <lb/>no appeal beyond the governor.</p>
                <p>The taxes, however, at the Cape, under which we <lb/>groan so painfully in this
                    country, are comparatively <lb/>trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a
                    heavy <lb/>import duty, but their purchase is matter of choice.&#x2013;
                    <lb/>This falls not upon the poor, not consequently will it <lb/>fall upon those
                    most likely to emigrate under the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the
                    Parliamentary grant.</p>
                <p>Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and <lb/>precautions, than the
                    encouragement bedd out in Mr <lb/>Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit, L.
                    10. is to be <lb/>made at the colonial office in Downing Street, by each
                    <lb/>individual. A free passage is to be granted, and on <lb/>reaching the Cape,
                    this deposit is to be returned to the <lb/>settler by the local government. And
                    such is the li<lb break="no"/>berality that has guided the proposed plans, it is
                        more<lb break="no"/>over stipulated, that if 100 families should agree to
                    <lb/>emigrate, and their minister with them, not only <lb/>permission will be
                    granted them so to do, but provi<lb break="no"/>sion will be made for him. The
                    separation from coun<lb break="no"/>try and from kindred is thus softened, and
                    it will allay <lb/>many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that <lb/>in
                    distant lands, and amongst a strange people, the <lb/>settler may still listen
                    to the voice and instruction of a <lb/>pastor, to whom custom, veneration, and
                    affection, have <lb/>all united to attach him.</p>
                <p>It appears that the experiment of a settlement of Eng<lb break="no"/>lish, has
                    already been made upon a limited plan at <lb/>Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour
                    in South Africa) : <lb/>and with such success as to give the best encourage<lb
                        break="no"/>ment to a more extensive emigration. Indeed, from <lb/>what we
                    have outselves seen of the colony and its great <lb/>facilities, we have no
                    doubt whatever of the benefits <lb/>that must arise to the sober, steady
                    exertions of the in<lb break="no"/>dustrious. At the Cape, or elsewhere, poverty
                    and <lb/>misery will attend the vicious and indolent, but <lb/>certain we are,
                    that there is no country under heaven, <lb/>where the poor may find a safer
                    asylum, and where ac<lb break="no"/>tivity, economy and good conduct, will meet
                    with so <lb/>certain and full a reward.</p>
                <p>During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a <lb/>Scotch regiment) at the
                    Cape, many of the privates <lb/>were known to save the whole of their pay, and
                    were <lb/>thus enabled to return to England with a very hand <lb/>some little
                    fortune. English servants of all descrip<lb break="no"/>tions are in great
                    request, and 1.5 sterling a month are <lb/>no uncommon wages for a tolerable
                    cook. It is never<lb break="no"/>theless to beremember, that clothes of all
                    kinds are <lb/>expensive at the Cape, as no manufactory is permitted, <lb/>lest
                    it should injure the trade of this country. Still <lb/>farmers in the country
                    dress very coarsely and cheaply ; <lb/>and their wives and daughters, except on
                    Sunday, are <lb/>humbly clad as themselves. Indeed, in so soft a <lb/>climate as
                    the Cape, there is that occasion for mul<lb break="no"/>tiplicity and warmth of
                    apparel which colder regions <lb/>require. For three-fourths of the year, the
                    best bed is <lb/>a hard mattress with a single coverlet.</p>
                <p>There is point which we cannot pass over ; as <lb/>we think it very intimately
                    connected with the virtue <lb/>and happiness of the settlers. And that is, the
                        educa<lb break="no"/>tion of their children. Nothing is more neglected than
                    <lb/>this in Southern Africa. The boors, (farmers) are <lb/>ignorant to a degree
                    passing credence. With the mi<lb break="no"/>nister that is to accompany 100
                    families, it would be <lb/>highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men
                    as <lb/>schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to in<lb break="no"
                    />troduce into the colony the Madras system of instruc<lb break="no"/>tion, and
                    a free school upon that plan has been esta<lb break="no"/>blished at Cape Town,
                    with considerable success. Still <lb/>the natives are stubbornly averse to
                    instruction. Their <lb/>luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all
                    <lb/>the necessaries of human life, and beyond this they <lb/>have neither wish
                    nor ambition. But if knowledge has <lb/>its fruits, ignorance has its weeds. The
                    savage and <lb/>unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been ex<lb
                        break="no"/>ercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants <lb/>by
                    these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want <lb/>of education, as a main
                    cause. The unjust limits <lb/>shown by the Dutch laws to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >white</hi> man's barbari<lb break="no"/>ties have doubtless encouraged
                    their perpetration &#x2013; <lb/>Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen,
                    and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, too much care cannot be taken to guard the fa<lb
                        break="no"/>milies of the new settlers against the contagion of the
                    <lb/>inhumanities that they must see practised around them, <lb/>and how far an
                    early and thorough acquaintance with <lb/>our duty to God and man will
                    counteract this influence <lb/>aided a knowledge of common school attainments,
                    <lb/>we need not say. The</p>
                <p>We have thrown these remarks together more as <lb/>loose hints for the
                    consideration of our readers, than <lb/>with any idea of furnishing a complete
                    view of so wide <lb/>and important a subject. We may be induced here<lb
                        break="no"/>after to review the question more in detail. The plan
                    <lb/>itself, as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer, <lb/>has at
                    present assumed a very imperfect shape. Ame<lb break="no"/>rice we have not
                    seen, and can only speak from the <lb/>reports of other. Those reports are
                    sufficiently dis<lb break="no"/>couraging. On the contrary, all who have seen
                    and <lb/>described the Cape, have united in praising it. Food <lb/>is cheap and
                    abundant, the price of labour is exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly high, trade is
                    important and increasing, many <lb/>parts of the colony are beautiful, and its
                    climate is <lb/>mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth <lb/>where
                    so many components of happiness will be found <lb/>to concentrate.</p>

                <p>The following circular has been addressed to <lb/>the parties whose lists of the
                    individuals engaged <lb/>to proceed with them as settlers to the Cape of
                    <lb/>Good Hope have been approved of by the Co<lb break="no"/>lonial Department:
                    &#x2013;</p>
                <p>Downing Street, London, 30th Sept. 1819.</p>
                <p>Sir &#x2013; I am directed by Earl Batburst to acquaint you, that <lb/>he has
                    under consideration your letter of, and <lb/>that he accepts the proposal which
                    you have mde, to take a <lb/>party of able bodied settlers, with their families,
                    to the Cape <lb/>of Good Hope, where a grant of land will accordingly be as<lb
                        break="no"/>signed to you on your arrival, in conformity with the regula<lb
                        break="no"/>tions laid down by his Majesty's Government.</p>
                <p>I have therefore to request, that you will immediately <lb/>transmit to me three
                    separate lists of the individuals who <lb/>have placed themselves under your
                    direction, and I inclose to <lb/>you proper returns for that purpose ; at the
                    same time, I deem <lb/>it necessary to mention, that it is absolutely requisite
                    that the <lb/>details respecting the individuals of your party which you are
                    <lb/>called upon to state in your returns should be correctly speci<lb

                    <lb/>particularly in respect of the age of the individuals, could not <lb/>fail
                    to be productive of much inconvenience. Upon receiving <lb/>there returns, I
                    shall lose no time in stating to you the amount <lb/>of the money which you will
                    be required to deposit under <lb/>the existing regulations, and the mode in
                    which the payment <lb/>is to be made.</p>

                <p>P.S. &#x2013; If there be any Officers on the half pay of the army <lb/>or navy,

                    list, specifying their usual <lb/>place of residence, and the designation under
                    which they are <lb/>respectively known at the War Office, and at the Admiralty,
                    <lb/>in order that I may take the necessary measures to enable <lb/>them to
                    receive their allowances in the colony.</p>
                <p>These persons should, on their part, immediately apply to <lb/>the Secretary at
                    War, and to the Secretary of the Admiralty, <lb/>stating their intention to

                <p>In making your arrangements for embarkation, it will be <lb/>necessary that you

                <p>Letters and papers have been received from Jamaica <lb/>to the 5 ult. We are

                    <lb/>"Private letters from Panama state, that Lord Co<lb break="no"/>chran had
                    taken Petit Callao[?], in which port a vessel <lb/>was at anchor, having on
                    board 100,000 dollars. It was <lb/>further said that his Lordship has passed
                    Guayaquil <lb/>oh his way to Chili. Almost a forthnight ago, intelli<lb
                        break="no"/>gence reached the Governor of Carthagena, from Santa <lb/>Fe,
                    that General Bolivar, who had been joined by one <lb/>of Murillo's Generals,
                    with a number of troops, was <lb/>making rapid advances towards Santa Fe with
                    upwards <lb/>of 5000 men ; and it was expected the next courier <lb/>would
                    announce[?] the fall of that place. An Aide-de<lb break="no"/> Camp of the
                    Governor of that place arrived at Car<lb break="no"/>thagena at midnight with
                    the above information. A<lb break="no"/>nother account states, that the
                    Venezuelian army, un<lb break="no"/>der General Bolivar in person, had obtained
                        posses<lb break="no"/>sion of Santa Fe, and that his advanced guard was at
                    <lb/>Honda[?] ; he had succeeded in cutting off the retreat of <lb/>General
                    Samana[?], the Captain-General of Santa Fe ; <lb/>his Secretary, Ramirez, has
                    arrived at Carthagena with <lb/>the above intelligence ; it was also added that
                    a part <lb/>of Bolivar's army would soon be in Mempaz[?].</p>
                <p>There have arrived at the port of Quebec, this pre<lb break="no"/>sent season
                    9,513 settlers.</p>
                <p>A letter from Demerara of the 14th August says <lb/>that a severe shock of an
                    earthquake had been felt in <lb/>that colony for the first time since the memory
                    of man[?]. <lb/>It occurred on the 12th. and continued for 30 se<lb break="no"

                    The funeral took <lb/>place on Sunday evening, with the honours due to his

                    Saturday, to inquire into <lb/>the circumstances of the supposed concealment of
                    two <lb/>deserters from the band of the 18th regiment of foot <lb/>on board his
                    Majesty's ships Phaeton[?], Captain W. H. <lb/>Dillon, in the month of October
                    last, when that ship <lb/>was about to proceed to the East Indies; and to try

                    conduct upon that occasion. The Court[?] <lb/>was crowded with officers, &amp;c.

                    <lb/>day, when Lieutenant Geary made his defence. The <lb/>Court having
                    considered the whole of the evidence, were <lb/>of opinion that the charge was
                    proved, and sentenced <lb/>him to be dismissed his Majesty's ship Phaeton, and

                <p>Letters from Port Jackson, New South Wales, dated <lb/>March 30th, were

                    convicts from England, <lb/>arrived on the 4th and 11th March. A schooner of
                    <lb/>80 tons burden, intended for the Chief of the Society <lb/>Islands, was to
                    be launched on the 7th of April. The <lb/>Shipley, with dispatches and troops on

                <p>Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?], dated <lb/>the 28th September, which
                    mention, that the plague <lb/>which had been for some time in the vicinity, had
                    at <lb/>length broken out in that town. We are happy to add <lb/>however, that
                    the deaths at that period were only three <lb/>or four each day, and it was then
                    confined to the <lb/>Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen
                    <lb/>victims to the pestilence. The weather being extreme<lb break="no"/>ly
                    cold, great hopes were entertained that the further <lb/>progress of the disease
                    would speedily be put a stop to <lb/>when trade, which then at a stand, would
                    renew <lb/>its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Moga<lb break="no"
                    />doru is between 10 and 12,000 persons ; by far the <lb/>greater part of whom
                    consider it contrary to their reli<lb break="no"/>gious tenets to use any
                    caution to prevent their taking <lb/>the infection ; and, in the event of their
                    having it <lb/>would not, for the same reason, have recourse to any <lb/>means
                    to counteract it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>[ From the Observer. ]</p>
                <p>The following letter from a lady who emigra<lb break="no"/>ted to America, from
                    within four miles of Godal<lb break="no"/>ming, in Surrey, two years back, has
                    been hand<lb break="no"/>ed to us for insertion. During the present rage
                    <lb/>for emigration, we think we are justified in giv<lb break="no"/>ing it
                    insertion, leaving it to those who are inte<lb break="no"/>rested in its
                    contents to draw their own con <lb/>clusions. We have reason to conclude that
                    the <lb/>letter is genuine, and is not, we believe, as many <lb/>have been which
                    have found their way into the <lb/>public press, the produce of ingenuity on
                    this <lb/>side the Atlantic: &#x2013;</p>
                <p>Philadelphia, July 29. 1818</p>
                <p>"My dear Sir &#x2013; I have received your welcome letter, to<lb break="no"
                    />gether with the patterns you were kind enough to forward <lb/>Although our
                    habits here are in many respects different from <lb/>those on your side of the
                    Atlantic, yet, I assure, there is a <lb/>considerable degree of anxiety among
                    our American belles for <lb/>English fasions ; and the display which your prompt
                        atten<lb break="no"/>tion to my request has enabled me to make, has procured
                    me <lb/>not alone a great influx of visitors, but of business. You ask <lb/>me
                    to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing <lb/>hither with your
                    wife and family. I can have no hesitation in <lb/>complying with this request ;
                    but, at the same time, I shrink <lb/>from the responsibility of your being
                    persuade, from any <lb/>things which I may say, to follow my example. It is
                    impossible <lb/>to disguise from myself, and I would not attempt to disguise
                    <lb/>it from you, that many who have come here, anticipating pro<lb break="no"
                    />sperity and independence, have failed ; but, at the same time, <lb/>as far as
                    my humble observation has enabled me to judge, I <lb/>am persuaded that many of
                    those failures have been the result <lb/>of unpardonable imprudence, and the
                    absence of that activity <lb/>and spirit of perseverance, by which persons
                    depending on <lb/>their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen
                    <lb/>many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from <lb/>having
                    left their native shores thoughtlessly, without more <lb/>money than was
                    sufficient to support them for a fortnight. &#x2013;. <lb/>This has been
                    dissipated, on their landing, almost before they <lb/>had recovered the effects
                    of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and <lb/>being thus reduced to extremity, their
                    spirits have failed, and <lb/>they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and
                    listless de<lb break="no"/>spair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades
                    to <lb/>follow, and will sumbit to degradation, as some of them <lb/>call it, of
                    becoming journeymen, do tolerably well.</p>
                <p>"With regards to myself, I need not recall to your mind the <lb/>species of
                    drudgery to which I was forced to submit, in order <lb/>to support a decent
                    appearance in London. You often joked <lb/>me on my enterprising disposition,
                    and doubted my resolution <lb/>to come to this country in search of that
                    independence which <lb/>I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am,
                    however, <lb/>and an hour since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work wo<lb
                        break="no"/>men, the lowest of whose weekly wages, I those who <lb/>take
                    their work home, is five dollars! You will start at this <lb/>and so will Mrs B.
                    It is, however, no less true than extraordi<lb break="no"/>nary. In short I have
                    every reason to be grateful to Providence <lb/>for having given me the
                    confidence to sufficient to try an experiment <lb/>which has turned out so
                    fortunately. I have commenced both <lb/>millinery and dress-making, to which I
                    have added the child<lb break="no"/>bed and ready made linen business ; and in
                    every one of <lb/>branches I am full of orders. My most sanguine hopes <lb/>have
                    been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly <lb/>1.60 Sterling and a
                    few of those articles of stock which <lb/>were necessary to make a show. These,
                    combined with the <lb/>attractive titled of " Miss P&#x2013;, from
                    London,'&amp;c. in a <lb/>few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did
                    my <lb/>utmost to please my customers, and, in a few months, moved <lb/>from a
                    situation of obscurity to one of the first respecta<lb break="no"/>bility. I am
                    thus particular because I know you feel an <lb/>interest in my fate. My brother
                    James, who you know <lb/>is a bricklayer and builder, has been equally
                    fortunate.&#x2013; <lb/>He has had several contracts, and is now building a row
                    of <lb/>twenty houses, besides other jobs of a smaller description.</p>
                <p>"Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from <lb/>Godalmbing and its
                    neighbourhood I am proud to say they <lb/>have all been tolerably successful.
                    The greater part of them, <lb/>you know, were farmers, and they are now settled
                    in farms <lb/>of from fifty to five hundred acres, from one hundred to one
                    <lb/>thousand miles from this place. All these, hoever, came <lb/>out with small
                    capitals&#x2013;but none with less than myself&#x2013;and <lb/>husbanding their
                    resources, and abstaining from extravagance <lb/>of every description, they
                    finally successed in laying the <lb/>foundation of their own future
                    happiness.</p>
                <p>We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; <lb/>but this must
                    wear off in the course of time?other there <lb/>is a roughness and absence of
                    what we call "good manners" <lb/>about some of the Americans, not at all
                    congenial to English <lb/>taste. They are for the most part, however, hospitable
                    ; <lb/>and if you let them have their way, and do not thwart their <lb/>humours,
                    are really very kind, and disposed to friendly inter<lb break="no"/>course. You
                    talk to carrying your family to the Western <lb/>states&#x2013;to the Illinois
                    country, and of commencing farmer <lb/>and storekeeping there. It is probably
                    that your views may be <lb/>very correct, but I think you may settle nearer to
                    us, if not <lb/>at so cheap a rate, at best with a greater certainty of present
                    <lb/>comfort. Of the Western States, I, of course, can know no<lb break="no"
                    />thing but by report. The emigration in that direction has <lb/>been immense,
                    but the journey to some has been so long, as <lb/>frequently to produce
                    repentance before the destined goal was <lb/>reached. We have had several
                    English, Scotch, and Irish fa<lb break="no"/>milies here, on the way to
                    Pittsburgh, who, I understand, <lb/>were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ;
                    but I have not <lb/>heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the
                    <lb/>Ohio in arks, which you say you have seen described in Birk<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>beck's books. No doubt these people must have to encounter <lb/>great
                    privations, and perhaps some danger ; time and perseve<lb break="no"/>rance,
                    however,will overcome all difficulties, and from the na<lb break="no"/>tural
                    course of things, in the end the great object in view, plenty <lb/>and
                    independence, must be attained ; and this as you very <lb/>justly say, is "worth
                    a struggle." Upon the whole, if you can <lb/>be content to give up all those
                    luxuries of which an English <lb/>fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits
                    of social inter<lb break="no"/>course to which an English neighbourhood give
                        encou<lb break="no"/>ragement ; and to derive happiness from the
                    consciousness of <lb/>seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the
                    necessaries <lb/>of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you,
                    <lb/>that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalan<lb break="no"
                    />ced by the castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these, <lb/>at least
                    you will be free here ; and as for society, your own <lb/>family, large as it
                    is, must be a treasure in itself ; added to <lb/>which, in proportion as wealth
                    increases, civilisation must <lb/>follow. If you could get three or four
                    families with whom <lb/>you are acquainted, to join in your plans and settle in
                    your <lb/>neighbourhood, an additional assuance of success and happi<lb
                        break="no"/>ness would be attained.</p>
                <p>"As to capital, I think you ought to hav, on your land<lb break="no"/>ing here,
                    L. 500, which, with moderate exertions and com<lb break="no"/>mon good fortune,
                    must afford yo uthe means of certain <lb/>prosperity. I shall, however, write
                    again in September on <lb/>this subject, when I intend sending for my sister,
                    and per<lb break="no"/>haps the information I may be able to collect in the
                    interim <lb/>will confirm your plans, and induce you to accompany her to
                    <lb/>this side of the water. I rather think we shall shortly have <lb/>another
                    cargo from Surrey ; I will let you know every parti<lb break="no"/>cular in my
                    next, as well as send you a list of the things, <lb/>which it will be policy for
                    you to bring with you. Your <lb/>seven children, instead of being a burden to
                    you here, will <lb/>form one of the most prominent sources of your wealth."</p>

                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to Canada</hi>.</p>
                <p>About ten days ago an emigrant arrived from <lb/>Canada, to Paisley, and brings
                    very favourable <lb/>intelligence from that country. He is a native <lb/>of
                    Scotland ; was some time in the army ; and <lb/>is going home again, as he calls
                    it, early in the <lb/>spring. This person gives the most satisfactory <lb/>and
                    cheering account of the place, and says his <lb/>chief complaint was the want of
                    society to share <lb/>in his felicities, to be companion of his joys, and
                    <lb/>to exult in his abundance. He adds that one of <lb/>his principal reasons
                    for coming here at present <lb/>was hearing of our distressed condition, and
                    <lb/>that he might be able to persuade others to follow his ex<lb break="no"
                    />ample ; anxious to be surrounded by happy, in<lb break="no"/>telligent, and
                    social neighbours. His arrival and <lb/>narrations, combined with other
                    circumstances, <lb/>have been the subject of considerable discussion <lb/>the
                    whole of last week. A strong desire <lb/>for emigration has been manifested, and
                    about <lb/>300 have already subscribed their names, as a <lb/>testimony of their
                    ardour to go away. A peti<lb break="no"/>tion is immediately to be forwarded to
                    his Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Ministers, imploring their assistance by <lb/>way
                    of loan or donation, to enable them to carry <lb/>their wishes into execution.
                    This petition, it is <lb/>said, is to be supported by the principal gentle<lb
                        break="no"/>men of the county, and the utmost anxiety <lb/>will doubtless
                    prevail concerning its success. &#x2013; <lb/>Let us hope that Government will
                    see the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of attending to the supplications of these
                    <lb/>people. The Sheriff Depute has been memoriali<lb break="no"/>zed upon the
                    subject, to give his counsel and sup<lb break="no"/>port in behalf of the
                    measure, and it is much to <lb/>his honour that he has evinced a great
                    disposition <lb/>to favour the object in view. His office has <lb/>been
                    appointed for the reception of signatures, <lb/>where the persons experience the
                    greatest kind<lb break="no"/>ness in every possible way. It is proper, at the
                    <lb/>same time, to mention, that a number who were <lb/>wishing to subscribe as
                    desirous to emigrate, have <lb/>been rejected ; as their circumstances were not
                    <lb/>of that despairing nature as to warrant an inter<lb break="no"/>position of
                    this kind in their favour. It cannot <lb/>be expected that those who enjoy a
                    considerable <lb/>degree of comfort at home, or who have sufficient <lb/>means
                    of their own to emigrate without public <lb/>aid, ought to be included among
                    that number des<lb break="no"/>tined to participate in this salutary and
                        benevo<lb break="no"/>lent proposition. Some of the fiercer radicals, with
                    <lb/>their accustomed zeal and spleen, are busily em<lb break="no"/>ployed in
                    jeering and deprecating the idea of <lb/>emigration and telling the " people to
                    stay and <lb/>help" in the recovery of their rights. They de<lb break="no"
                    />clare the whole scheme to be a mere farce, in<lb break="no"/>tended to be
                    played against them, in order to <lb/>destroy the unanimity which they say
                    exists in <lb/>the nation concerning their grand object. These <lb/>querulous
                    politicians complain of the climate of <lb/>Canada, and it must be granted that
                    it resembles <lb/>Italy more than Scotland, being hotter in sum<lb break="no"
                    />mer and coller in winter than our own island <lb/>but the country is healthy,
                    the soil is fruitful <lb/>and strong constitutions and longevity are as
                    <lb/>common there as in any other part of the globe. <lb/>The same manners,
                    language, and regulations <lb/>prevail in Upper Canada as in Scotland, and
                    <lb/>when people have plenty of provisions, fuel and <lb/>warm clothing to
                    resist the effects of heavy snows <lb/>and intense frosts, the objection of cold
                    is less <lb/>worthy of consideration. &#x2013; <hi rend="italic">Glasgow

                <p>(From Lavaysse's Account of Venezuela, Trinidad, Mar<lb break="no"/>garitta, and
                    Tobago, just published.)</p>
                <p>Stedman, after having given a picture of the cruelties <lb/>practised on the
                    negroes at Surinam, relates that on his <lb/>arrival in that colony, a white man
                    was flagged by a black <lb/>executioner, for having stolen some money from the
                        town<lb break="no"/>house ; and he remarked that this negro inflicted the
                        pu<lb break="no"/>nishment with great signs of commiseration. A negro
                    <lb/>was broken on the wheel for the same crime, and he bore <lb/>that horrible
                    punishment without a sigh. A moment af<lb break="no"/>terwards, they prepared to
                    hang another, and whilst the <lb/>hangman was tying the cord round his neck to
                    launch him <lb/>into eternity, he looked steadfastly, with a smile of con<lb
                        break="no"/>tempt, at his judges, who were among the spectators of the
                    <lb/>execution. " Having expressed to the persons who were <lb/>near me, (says
                    Captain Stedman) how much I was shock<lb break="no"/>ed with the injustice and
                    cruelty of those executions, <lb/>and surprised at the intrepidity of the
                    negroes during the <lb/>punishment, a very decent looking man thus addressed
                    <lb/>me ; Sir, you are newly arrived from Europe ; but if you <lb/>were better
                    acquainted with negro slaves, what you now <lb/>see would neither excite your
                    surprise nor your pity. It <lb/>is not long since I saw a negro suspended from
                    that very <lb/>gibbet by the ribs. The following is the manner in which <lb/>it
                    was done : two incisions were made in his side, in which <lb/>was passed an iron
                    hook attached to a chain. He lived <lb/>three days suspended in that manner, his
                    head and feet <lb/>hanging down, licking from his bleeding breast the drops
                    <lb/>of water that fell on it, for it rained at the time. The <lb/>sufferer did
                    not, however, utter a groan, and never once <lb/>complained. On the third day,
                    another negro was flogged <lb/>under the gallows, and having cried from pain,
                    the former <lb/>reproached him for his want of courage: " Are you a <lb/>man?"
                    said he to him, " you behave like a child!" &#x2013; <lb/>A moment afterwards
                    the soldier who was sentry <lb/>on the spot taking pity on him, dashed out his
                    brains <lb/>with the butt end of his musquet. " I saw another <lb/>negro
                    quartered," the narrator: " After his <lb/>arms and legs were tied to four very
                    strong horses, an <lb/>iron nail was driven under each nail of his hands and
                    feet <lb/>He suffered that without complaining, requested a glass of <lb/>ru,,
                    and ordered the executioners to let loose the horses. <lb/>But that which amused
                    us most," continued this monster, <lb/>"was the humour of the fellow, who, when
                    the hangman <lb/>presented the glass of rum to him that he had asked for,
                    <lb/>told him to drink first, as he was very much afraid of be<lb break="no"
                    />poisoned, and desired him to take care that his horses <lb/>should not kick
                    him. As for old negroes being broken on <lb/>the wheel, and young women burnt
                    alive, nothing is more <lb/>common in this colony!"</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Birkbeck's Settlement</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A small pamphlet has lately been published, consisting of letters <lb/>and
                    extracts of letters from Mr Birkbeck, of which we have been procured <lb/>a
                    copy. The author's object appears chiefly to have been to counter<lb break="no"
                    />act the misrepresentations circulated on the subject of the settlement <lb/>by
                    Cobbett. We read Cobbett's remarks when they were first trans<lb break="no"
                    />mitted to this country, and certainly did not think them worthy of the
                    <lb/>notice here bestowed upon them. His objections to the new settle<lb
                        break="no"/>ment, helped out as they were misquotation and misconstruction,
                    <lb/>were of very little weight, except in so far as they applied to all emi<lb
                        break="no"/>gration whatever ; and they had really nothing to render them
                    worth <lb/>reading, but the sarcasm and caustic humour which accompanied
                    <lb/>them. We should, therefore, have been better pleased had Mr Birk<lb
                        break="no"/>beck allowed this restless controversist to wallow in the mire
                    of his own <lb/>endless contradiction, and rather given us some more details
                        regard<lb break="no"/>ing the settlement. The Americans are every year
                    pushing forward <lb/>into the wilderness ; but it is a new thing for a body of
                    our country<lb break="no"/>men, when withdrawing from a society richly provided
                    with all the <lb/>accomodations which wants of civilized life render necessary
                    <lb/>to pass through the settled and cultivated parts of the New World <lb/>and
                    to retire to the untrodden waste a thousand miles from the sea <lb/>Though the
                    activity of commerce carries many of the convenienes <lb/>and even luxuries of
                    life to this remote place, still the settlers must <lb/>find such a difference
                    in their situation as must subject them to go ma<lb break="no"/>ny privations ;
                    and some details, shewing how the colonists got over <lb/>their difficulties,
                    how their various wants were supplied, and how the <lb/>feelings and habits of
                    civilized life accommodated themselves to the <lb/>woods and the wilderness,
                    would have been much more interesting <lb/>than a reply to Cobbett's captious
                    objections. One of the most try<lb break="no"/>ing privations of the colony
                    seems to be a want of wives, an evil <lb/>which happily does not affect the
                    mother country, amidst all her other <lb/>sufferings. The evil has probably been
                    aggravated by some of the co<lb break="no"/>lonists forgetting to take their
                    wives with them. If matters don't <lb/>get better in this particular, we may
                    expect to hear of some of the <lb/>adjoining American towns suffering a Sabine
                    spoliation. A cargo <lb/>of young ladies would evidently be one of the best
                    mercantile specu<lb break="no"/>lations ; and as our own city had surplus of ten
                    or twelve thousand <lb/>females at the last census, we have no doubt that some
                    of our enter<lb break="no"/>prising export traders will take the hint, and, by
                    scouring the board<lb break="no"/>ing-schools, complete a choice assortment,
                    adapted to the Illinois <lb/>market.</p>
                <p>The following extracts the only parts that appear to have any <lb/>general
                    interest.</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="italic">English Prairie, July</hi> 13. 1819. <lb/>"My Friends and
                    Countrymen,&#x2013;For your service I exhibited, in <lb/>two publications, an
                    outline of the process of emigration, from its <lb/>commencement up to the final
                    settlement.</p>
                <p>"My first opinion of this, the spot of our choice, and the reasoning <lb/>on
                    which that choice was grounded, are before you ; and sufficient <lb/>time has
                    elapsed to try those opinnions by the test of experience, by <lb/>which they are
                    confirmed in every important particular. I showed <lb/>you my own tract through
                    the gloomy forest into a delightful coun<lb break="no"/>try, better prepared for
                    an abode by the hand of nature than the heavy <lb/>woods by half a century of
                    labour. I built me a cabin, and "belayed <lb/>a road to it;" for it was my
                    ambition to be surrounded by my old <lb/>friends and neighbours. In this, too, I
                    am gratified ; and we are con<lb break="no"/>tented with out allotment, both as
                    to our present state and future <lb/>prospects.</p>
                <p>"This small district, which two years ago was nearly without inha<lb break="no"
                    />bitants, contains a thriving population of from six to seven hundred
                    <lb/>persons. We have been blessed with health most unusual for a new
                    <lb/>settlement, or for any settlement of equal numbers in any country ;
                    <lb/>and no doubt is entertained by us, or by any judicious observer, of its
                    <lb/>salubrity. We have several wells of excellent water, and many more <lb/>are
                    in progress. Our soil is fertile beyond my own expectation ; but <lb/>our
                    exertions have hitherto been chiefly directed to the permanent <lb/>objects of
                    building and fencing, of which much has already been <lb/>done. We have,
                    however, collected a stock of hogs and cattle ; and <lb/>I think acres of corn
                    are now growing than there are indivi<lb break="no"/><cb/>
                    <lb/>duals in the settlement."</p>
                <p>"With regard to pecuniary success, the capitalist is commencing <lb/>his
                    operations, or looking around him undecided as to the course he <lb/>shall
                    pursue ; but the labourer has <hi rend="italic">made</hi> an <hi rend="italic"
                        >establishment</hi>. It is not <lb/>with him as with the capitalist, a state
                    of hope merely, from good <lb/>prospects, but of enjoyment, from good
                    possessions. Numbers of <lb/>this class, and of mechanics, have already realized
                    their little free<lb break="no"/>holds, and are building cabins for themselves.
                    The fruits of their <lb/>labour are not squandered in dissipation and excess,
                    because they <lb/>have highr objects ; and, considering their former depressed
                        condi<lb break="no"/>tion, it is astonishing to me, as it is honourable to
                    them, that they be<lb break="no"/>try no arrogance in their to
                    independence."</p>
                <p>"In the statements I have published, I see little to correct, as far <lb/>as my
                    observation and experience have now proceeded, excepting that, <lb/>in my view
                    of the profits of cultivation to early settlers, I have not <lb/>made sufficient
                    allowance in time for the innumerable delays and dis<lb break="no"/>appointments
                    inseparable from new undertakings in a new country. <lb/>A year of preparatory
                    and unproductive exertion should be added to <lb/>the debtor-side of the account
                    at the outset."</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Proceedings of the Court</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Lord Provost <hi rend="smallcaps">Manderston</hi> having been called to the
                    Chair, the <lb/>Clerk, Mr A. Boswell, read a very distinct report of the results
                    and <lb/>general features of the transactions at the Infirmary and Queensber<lb
                        break="no"/>ry House Hospital for the last year. The Lord Provost then named
                    <lb/>a Committee to examine the Treasurer's accounts, &amp;c., and report to
                    <lb/>the adjourned meeting to be held in February next.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr John Witham</hi> junior then rose, and requested leave to
                    submit <lb/>a few observations to the consideration of the Court. He stated in
                    <lb/>substance that, though aware of its not being usual to vote thanks to
                    <lb/>the Managers until their accounts have been examined, he was yet
                    <lb/>anxious to embrace the first opportunity of expressing his conviction
                    <lb/>that the exertions of the Managers had, at last, placed this valuable
                    <lb/>Institution on a most desirable footing. Although he had not visited
                    <lb/>the Hospital for the last twelve months, he had not ceased to take an
                    <lb/>interest in its welfare ; and it was with great pleasure that he now
                    <lb/>stated, that whether his inquiries were made of the medical attendants,
                    <lb/>or of <hi rend="italic">recent patients,</hi> the answers were uniformly
                    satisfactory. The <lb/>Hospital was favoured with a good Matron, between whom
                    and the <cb/>
                    <lb/>medical gentlemen the best understanding existed ; and the various
                    <lb/>salutary regulations of the Managers have led to such a prosperous
                    <lb/>state of things, as justly to entitle them to the gratitude of this Court
                    <lb/>and the public. Still, however, he must say, that although the Hospi<lb
                        break="no"/>tal was in a good state, yet, in his mind, Visitors could not
                    fall to afford <lb/>that assistance to the Managers here, and that security
                    against internal <lb/>abuses, which they had done in so many other similar
                    institutions. It <lb/>was difficult to account for the prejudices which existed
                    against this spe<lb break="no"/>cies of assistance in Edinburgh. At Leeds, in
                    addition, to visitors of <lb/>our sex, there was a committee of ladies, who
                    visisted the female wards, <lb/>and from the joint labours of both classes of
                    visitors many and great <lb/>advantages had resulted. But in this city we had
                    hospitals for fe<lb break="no"/>males, which are governed by men only, without
                    seeking any help <lb/>from visitors of that sex, who are much better qualified
                    to discharge <lb/>most of the duties. This view of these matters, he trusted,
                    would yet <lb/>be attended to.&#x2013;He must also crave the attention of the
                        meet<lb break="no"/>ing to another matter, that of the L.11,700, for which
                    the city of E<lb break="no"/>dinburgh pays only 4 1/2 per cent. He assured the
                    Court, and its Ho<lb break="no"/>noured Chairman, that this subject was not
                    introduced with the view <lb/>of touching upon, or insinuating any thing
                    respecting the city's af<lb break="no"/>fairs. The money, he understood, was
                    secured on the ale duty ; but <lb/>why should the Hospital lose one-half per
                    cent, of interest? He had <lb/>once made a calculation, according to which the
                    loss, from the be<lb break="no"/>ginning, had amounted to about L.10,000. It had
                    been stated that <lb/>the Magistrates of Edinburgh had always been friendly to
                    the Hos<lb break="no"/>pital ; but that was surely no reason for withholding
                    L.59 of interest <lb/>that whatever former Magistrates had thought on the
                    subejct the <lb/>present would not submit to the idea of depriving the Hospital
                    of any <lb/>part of its lawful interest. If the ground on which the Hospital was
                    <lb/>built was alluded to, it was plain that town had already got more, <lb/>by
                    the reduced interest than its original value. The town of Edin<lb break="no"
                    />burgh had also got L.8273 ; 17 ; 3 of invalid money from Govern<lb break="no"
                    />ment, on condition of paying <hi rend="italic">the interest</hi> to the
                    Infirmary, <hi rend="italic">which inte-</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, if paid at two terms in the years, should be
                    restricted to 3 1/2 per <lb/>cent. And as the property tax&#x2013;which the Town
                    did not retain from <lb/>the Hospital, whether they did or did not pay it to
                    Government,&#x2013;is <lb/>now at an end, he could see no reason for withholding
                    the usual rate <lb/>of interest. He concluded by suggesting the names of several
                        gentle<lb break="no"/>men as a Committee, to lend out the sum of L.11,700 on
                    interest at <lb/>5 per cent, if the Magistrates of Edinburgh should decline to
                    pay that <lb/>rate of interest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Alex. Cruishank</hi> seconded the motion</p>
                <p>Col. <hi rend="smallcaps">Crichton</hi> regretted that the respectable gentlemen
                    should have <lb/>introduced such a motion. He seldom visisted the Infirmary, but
                    <lb/>when he sent patients to it ; but he could state, that when his servants
                    <lb/>or workmen have been there from fever, the attention they received <lb/>was
                    in every respect equal to what he, and he hoped he was a respec<lb break="no"
                    />table citizen, could command in his own house. But he could men<lb break="no"
                    />tion the testimony of one whose authority was much higher than his <lb/>own
                    &#x2013; that of a medical gentlemen of some eminence in his profes<lb
                        break="no"/>sion, who lives abroad, and who was recently in this country.
                    That <lb/>professional gentleman spoke the very highest terms both of the
                    <lb/>medical treatment and the economy of the House. It was matter <lb/>of
                    pride, he said, to every Scotsman, to hear the manner in which the
                    <lb/>Infirmary of Edinburgh was spoke of in all the quarters of the globe.
                    <lb/>It was the pattern of all that was excellent in such institutions, and a
                    <lb/>nursery of the most skilfull practitioners ; for go where we will, the
                    <lb/>answer to almost every question put with respect to improved hospi<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>tal treatment is, that it was learned in the Infirmary of Edinburgh.
                    <lb/>Whether, indeed, we thought of these things ; whether we looked at <lb/>the
                    sublime inscriptions on the outside of the Hospital, and the Chris<lb break="no"
                    />tain doctrines and principles there inculcated or the treatement and
                    <lb/>management within we could not fail to be struck with admiration <lb/>and
                    without imputing any motives, which he was not entitled to do <lb/>he must say,
                    it would be much more creditable to the respectable gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen if
                    they should confine themselves to expressing their high o<lb break="no"/>pinion
                    of the institution and tanking the Managers instead of oc<lb break="no"/>cupying
                    the valuable time of this Honourable Court with quibbling <lb/>about trifles,
                    which were every way contemptible. After a pause, <lb/>Col. Crichton made a
                    counter motion, to get rid of Mr Wigham's.</p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Meadowbank</hi> reminded the Court, that this matter of
                        inte<lb break="no"/>rest had already been under the consideration of a
                    Committee, and <lb/>decided on by the Court.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Henry Jardine</hi>, Esq. begged to mention a fact that the
                    Town of <lb/>Edinburgh had contributed L.50 to the Infirmary for the last
                    year.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Ritchie</hi> rose and said, that though perfectly aware
                    of what the <lb/>result would be, he could not allow the matter to be settled
                    without <lb/>giving Mr Wigham's motion his support. It gave him much pleasure
                    <lb/>to find it was no longer unfashionable to allude to Christian doc<lb
                        break="no"/>trines in such meetings as this,&#x2013;a change from which he
                    anticipated <lb/>much good. He concurred in what had been said on this subject
                    by <lb/>the gentleman at the foot of the Table ; but he begged to remind him
                    <lb/>that it was a great principle of Christianity, that nothing was too tri<lb
                        break="no"/>fling to be attended to it it promised good; and the additional
                    interest of <lb/>the money in question would obviously extend the means of <hi
                        rend="italic">healing</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">the sick</hi>, the great object of the Institution.
                    Nothing, indeed, which <lb/>had fallen from that gentleman, or the Learned Lord
                    on the other <lb/>side, could meet or touch the simple proposition, that <hi
                        rend="italic">five per cent</hi> is <lb/>the legal rate of interest, and
                    that the Town of Edinburgh ought not <lb/>to pay less.</p>
                <p>There was another subject alluded to by Mr Wigham, on which, if <lb/>Mr W. did
                    not, he would submit a motion, namely, <hi rend="italic">Visitori</hi> 'And
                    <lb/>this he conceived was the fittest time for appointing them. All sides
                    <lb/>of the house were, now agreed that the Hospital was admirably con<lb
                        break="no"/>ducted. It was impossible, therefore, to suppose that the
                    measure <lb/>was proposed from any distrust of the Managers. If the management
                    <lb/>was perfect now, it was too much to expect it could continue so ; and
                    <lb/>this was the proper time for providing against the future. In other
                    <lb/>places the highest characters in the land had acted with visitors ; and
                    <lb/>much benefit had been derived from them in England, and even at
                    <lb/>Glasgow. If human nature, therefore, was not different in Edin<lb
                        break="no"/>burgh from wht it is on the other side of the Tweed, and in the
                    west <lb/>of Scotland, it must be admitted that Visitors would be beneficial
                    <lb/>here also. Besides, as the Managers were aware of their strength, <lb/>and
                    that no measure could be carried here without their consent, the <lb/>granting
                    of Visitors would be a <hi rend="italic">boon</hi> from themselves. He moved,
                    <lb/>that this Court do annually name 24 or more Visitors to act month<lb
                        break="no"/>ly by rotation, and minute such observations as shall occur to
                    them <lb/>for the consideration of the Managers.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Wigham</hi> seconded the motion ; but as the Court seemed
                    averse <lb/>to entertain it, it was withdrawn.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Ritchie</hi> then said, that as his last motion was
                    intended chiefly <lb/>as a caveat to the Committee named by the Lord Provost, he
                    would <lb/>also, with the same view, state the nature of a motion which he
                        wish<lb break="no"/>ed to submit, but the merits of which he was not then
                    fully prepared <lb/>to state. it was one, however, of which he was sure it would
                    not be <lb/>said, that it was introduced for the purpose of giving trouble, or
                        un<lb break="no"/>necessarily occupying the time of the Court. Its object
                    was the pro<lb break="no"/>motion of medical science, and its nature would be
                    understood by <lb/>his reading a single paragraph from the able Clinical Reports
                    of Dr <lb/>Duncan junior. " Almost all hospitals (it is there stated,) publish
                    <lb/>annual Reports; but in many cases they are intended only to fur<lb
                        break="no"/>nish information as to the expenditure of the funds, and the
                    names of <lb/>the office-bearers, and as a public acknowledgement of the support
                    of <lb/>the subscribers. Such reports, however, are of no use in marking the
                    <lb/>progress of disease, and, except for purposes mentioned above, do po<lb
                        break="no"/>sitive harm, by causing hospital reports in general to be
                    neglected as <lb/>utterly without value. This, however, is not the case ; and
                    the re<lb break="no"/>ports we have of late years received from the Fever
                    Hospitals of <lb/>Dublin and Cork are worthy of being imitated by hospitals of
                    every <lb/>kind and in every place. Indeed, the public have a right to expect
                    this <lb/>information in return for their liberality in supporting them. We have <cb/>
                    <lb/>only to add, that the most valuable reports often proceed entirely from
                    <lb/>the zeal of the reporters, and are only occasional. This leads <lb/>us to
                    suggest, that the governors of hospitals should enjoin their regu<lb break="no"
                    />lar as a duty upon their medical officers ; and we will <lb/>venture to say,
                    that where it has not yet been practised, its good ef<lb break="no"/>fects upon
                    the institution in an economical as well as professional <lb/>points of view,
                    will soon be apparent."&#x2013;His motion went to carry this <lb/>suggestion
                    into effect ; and without farther preface he should now <lb/>read it. The
                    substance of it was, that in addition to the Journal kept <lb/>at present,
                    Digest of the whole should be kept in a <hi rend="italic">tabular form</hi> but
                    <lb/>especially of the date of admission, age, sex, and place of residence
                    <lb/>of the patients ; date of commencement, crisis, termination and as<lb
                        break="no"/>signed causes of their diseases ; with a diary of the
                    temperatures and <lb/>moisture of the atmosphere, state of winds, prices of
                    staple pro<lb break="no"/>visions &amp;c. ; with an annual medical report,
                    taking notice of the in<lb break="no"/>crease or decrease of population, and of
                    the employment, diet and ha<lb break="no"/>bits of the labouring classes, as far
                    as practicable. Some of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, he observed, seemed to be
                    amused with this enumeration ; but <lb/>the medical gentlemen would be aware of
                    what he pointed at. With <lb/>their peculiar and proper duties, he had no wish
                    to interfere. They <lb/>knew them well, and discharged them faithfully and
                    honourably. In <lb/>their practise they attended to every thing that was
                    necessary ; but <lb/>their knowledge often died with him ; and his object was to
                    preserve <lb/>the results of their skill and experience.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord President</hi> said he hoped the gentlemen who had
                    made <lb/>this motion, would see, on reflection, from the labour and time
                        requi<lb break="no"/>site to carry it into effect, how very impracticable it
                    would be in an <lb/>hospital like that of the Royal Infirmary, where the
                    Managers had no <lb/>compulsory authority over the medical gentlemen, whose time
                    was <lb/>so occupied with their own private avocations.</p>
                <p>The Proposer of the motion said, that instead answering what had <lb/>fallen from
                    the Right Honourable Judge in his own language, he <lb/>would beg leave to read
                    another passage from Dr Duncan's volu<lb break="no"/>ble publication, and which,
                    he hoped, would obviate some of the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties adverted to. "
                    The trouble (says Dr Duncan,) of keeping <lb/>such tabular records, is not so
                    great as might be supposed. It requires <lb/>only system and regularity; and
                    when we see how easily it is done in <lb/>the military hospital, <hi
                        rend="italic">we cannot help regretting that it is not also in-</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">troduced general into civil hospitals.</hi> If the
                    practitioner himself has <lb/>not time to fill up the columns of the prescribed
                    table, it would be <lb/>very little additional trouble to his clerk ; or if the
                    time of that assis<lb break="no"/>tant would not easily permit him, <hi
                        rend="italic">the duty would be very gladly taken</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">by another of the Hospital pupils.</hi></p>
                <p>Dr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hope</hi>, in a neat and eloquent speech, opposed the
                    motion. The <lb/>Managers, he said, were willing to give due consideration to
                    every <lb/>proposal from whatever quarter it might come. The present, how<lb
                        break="no"/>ever, he considered as impractiable. To prepare tabular records
                    of <lb/>the nature suggested, required great experience, much comprehens<lb
                        break="no"/>ion and many talents. It was a task which every one was not
                        qua<lb break="no"/>lified to discharge in a mnner could be beneficial to the
                    public, <lb/>and one which gentlemen, who lived by their profession, could not
                    be <lb/>expected to undertake. The case was different in military hospitals,
                    <lb/>where the medical getlmen could devote the whole of their time to
                    <lb/>their hospital duties. But it should be know, that the materials for
                    <lb/>making up such tables are all recorded in the infirmary Journals ; and
                    <lb/>that these Journals are open to <hi rend="italic">all the medical
                        attendants;</hi> so that <lb/>whoever finds that he has time and talents for
                    the performance of <lb/>such tasks, has the fullest opportunity for undertaking
                    and complet<lb break="no"/>ing them. Accordingly we had had the very able
                    reports of Dr <lb/>Duncan, and the useful work of Dr Welsh. The Institution has
                    now <lb/>the benefit of Dr Duncan's services ; and he considered it better to
                    <lb/>leave the completion of such works and reports to the zeal and talents
                    <lb/>of individuals.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mover</hi> then stated that he was perfectly aware of Dr.
                    Welsh's <lb/>judicious publication as well as Dr Duncan's and he certainly would
                    <lb/>never have introduced such a measure, had it not been suggested and
                    <lb/>recommended by a much abler mind than his own. He had not un<lb break="no"
                    />dertaken the task from any idea that he was able to do it justice, or
                    <lb/>that he could do it better, or even so well as many other members of
                    <lb/>the Court ; but from the conviction, that if he had not introduced the
                    <lb/>subject, it would be introduced at all. He had no wish, however <lb/>to
                    give unnecessary trouble, and should, therefore, for the present, beg <lb/>leave
                    to withdraw his motion.</p>

                <p>Our readers will learn with pleasure, that the Lord Advocate, <lb/>with a
                    laudable anxiety for the honour of our criminal jurispru<lb break="no"/>dence,
                    has announced officially, that the Clerk of Court "strikes the <lb/>Jury, by
                    taking <hi rend="italic">45</hi> after <hi rend="italic">45, until they served
                        in rotation.</hi>" They <lb/>consist of a " list of Jurymen furnished by the
                    High Constables" <lb/>for Edinburgh and those "regularly required from the
                    counties of <lb/>Linlithgow and Haddington," which names " were <hi
                        rend="italic">then</hi> put up<lb break="no"/>on a roll, which was put into
                    the bands of the Clerk of Court;"&#x2013; <lb/>the Jurors thus struck being
                    cited, not by a Sheriff officer, but by <lb/>a Macer of the Justiciary ourt. We
                    are not aware of any law <lb/>which requires the Clerk of Court to take the
                    Jurors by rotation ; <lb/>but it reflects great credit on his judgement that he
                    resorts to this <lb/>unequivocal mode of displaying his impartiality. This is a
                    virtue <lb/>which the law requires in all its officers ; and it is fortunate
                    when <lb/>such rules are devised and adhered to as make the virtue incon<lb
                        break="no"/>trovertibly visible. At such an advanced stage of society,
                    honour <lb/>and public opinion will secure impartial justice ; but still, when
                    <lb/>the possibility of some retrograde movement is adverted to, it <lb/>would
                    be a wise measure to convert what all functionaries do at <lb/>present from
                    principle, into specific rules for directing the conduct <lb/>of their
                    successors. The Lord Advocate, it has been reported, is <lb/>about to introduce
                    into Parliament a Bill or Bills respecting the <lb/>Judicatories of Scotland ;
                    and his Lordship, it is obvious, might <lb/>obtain a well-merited popularity by
                    throwing in some clauses to <lb/>fix the qualifications of a Juror in the
                    different counties of Scot<lb break="no"/>land, and to regulate the times and
                    the manner in which lists of <lb/>Jurors are to be made up, reduced into a penl
                    of 45, and then to <lb/>a jury of 15. Ther is, if we mistake not, a cerain
                    discretion on <lb/>more than one of these points left with functionaries, who,
                    we <lb/>doubt not, would most readily part with it. To them it would be <lb/>a
                    relief ; and though the arraigned might sometimes have less im<lb break="no"
                    />partial juries than at present, yet, if the ballot were introduced <lb/>here,
                    as it has recently been in civil cases, the impartiality would <lb/>be more
                    coguisable, and placed beyond the reach of doubt and <lb/>misrepresentation. It
                    would be no disgrace to Scotland to bor<lb break="no"/>row in this respect from
                    her sister kingdom, but an honour which <lb/>France seems willing to do herself
                    at present, and which we very <lb/>lately did ourselves in modelling our Jury
                    Court.</p>
                <p>Mr Bywater has construced a small model of a ship in such <lb/>a manner as to
                    exhibity, by actual experiment, the principal <lb/>magnetic phenomena mentioned
                    by Captain Flinders, in his <lb/>voyage to New Holland. From a minute attention
                    to the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, Mr B. has devised a plan, which, in all
                    probability, will <lb/>remedy, by very simple means, the defect arising from the
                        lo<lb break="no"/>cal attraction pointed out by Captain Flinders, and thus
                    be of <lb/>real advantage to the science of navigation. A drawing of <lb/>this
                    plan (as it will be important to ships of war) has been sent <lb/>to the
                    Admiralty.</p>

                <p>The greater number are decieved; they know no<lb break="no"/>[?] of this country.
                    Many leave Great Britain from <lb/>[?] discontents; and such the province is
                    better. <lb/>[?]. Lately the notes of Mr. Birkbeck have ex<lb break="no"/>[?]
                    much consideration; and all his assertions have <lb/>[?] believed, without

                    forest, where they have fre<lb break="no"/>[?] to sleep under the canopy of
                    heaven with a <lb/>[?]. He is forced to take the axe in his hand, <lb/>[?] in
                    felling the pines of which he is to make <lb/>[?], which he builds at a great
                    distance <lb/>[?] neighbour&#x2013;opening to a wet plain, in <lb/>[?] and an
                    impenetrable forest in the rear. This <lb/>[?] covered with bark&#x2013;it has
                    no floor but <lb/>[?] as the surrounding country is flat, there <lb/>[?], and no
                    boards to be had. Mr Birk<lb break="no"/>[?] date not leave home, for any
                    distance, with<lb break="no"/>[?] guide; and his children cannot go twenty
                    <lb/>[?] from the house, without being lost. He gets <lb/>[?] pressing of his
                    wants supplied at an enor<lb break="no"/>mous[?] expense. And now, that he is on
                    his land. <lb/>[?] shall he do; it is covered with trees, or it is <lb/>[?]
                    unhealthy; and if he hire people to work, <lb/>[?] of the farm will never pay
                    them: but <lb/>[?] bae servants, and he is obliged to sit down <lb/>[?] them,
                    and to become their companion. Mr. <lb/>Birkbeck[?], who was accustomed to go
                    from one field <lb/>to another, admiring his crops and his cattle, and
                    <lb/>thing to do but to give the servants their orders <lb/>the day, and saw all
                    his works proceeding as ra<lb break="no"/>[?] as he wished, now finds himself an
                    insulated <lb/>[?], surrounded by a few miserable fiels, taken <lb/>[?] the bog,
                    and full of musquetoes; his children <lb/>[?] sick from this unhealthy
                    situation; and, in <lb/>[?] severe disease, beyond the reach of medical
                    <lb/>assistance. It is possible to believe that, under such <lb/>circumstances,
                    he does not regret the country he has <lb/>[?]. And let me not be told that the
                    prospect of <lb/>[?]] his children a rich inheritance will turn the <lb/>[?]
                    into sweet&#x2013;he is not that sort of man; nor do <lb/>[?] any law of nature
                    which urges a parent to <lb/>[?] his own happiness, in order to confer a
                        doubt<lb break="no"/>[?] upon his children. We allow that, after a <lb/>[?],
                    he will be surrounded with neighbours; <lb/>[?] their society is not very
                    agreeable; it is indeed <lb/>[?], as Mr Birkbeck himself admits. After <lb/>[?]
                    his connexions, his country, all his early <lb/>[?] and pleasing recollections,
                    his ease and <lb/>[?] what does he gain? Some landed property, <lb/>[?] he dies
                    in improving, in an unhealthy situa<lb break="no"/>tion[?]. He may not be able
                    to leave a farm to each of his <lb/>children[?]; but of what use will they be if
                    not culti<lb break="no"/>vated[?]? And he will discover in the bitterness of
                    <lb/>[?], that this legacy is not equal to the placing <lb/>[?] upon a farm,
                    though taken at a rack-rent. <lb/>[?] different the situation of a loyal farer,
                        pos<lb break="no"/>[?] of Mr. Birkbeck's substance, if he should <lb/>[?]
                    this province[?]![?] He need not go ten miles from <lb/>[?] settlement, even if
                    he went at once up<lb break="no"/>[?] lands granted him by the crown. But, if he
                    <lb/>[?] an improved farm, his privations will be <lb/>[?] compared to those
                    which he must suffer in <lb/>[?] to the back settlements of the United States,
                    as <lb/>[?] still more fully appear.</p>
                <p>It should not, however, be forgotten, that, with <lb/>[?] possible advantage of
                    soil, neighbourhood, <lb/>[?] climate, emigration to America, a country so
                    <lb/>[?] from Great Britain, is a matter of deep and <lb/>[?] consideration. The
                    persons emigrating <lb/>[?] civil in their property, break up all commerce,
                    <lb/>[?], and connexions in the country they are leav<lb break="no"/>[?] and if
                    they find their expectations disappoint<lb break="no"/>[?] the country of their
                    choice, they are ashamed, <lb/>perhaps unable, to return. Emigrants often fail,
                    <lb/>[?] they have never examined their subjects pro<lb break="no"/>[?] and
                    find, on trial, that they do not possess <lb/>qualities to insure
                    success.&#x2013;The habits, <lb/>knowledge, and accomodation of manners,
                    <lb/>[?] this new life requires, are not, perhaps, na<lb break="no"/>[?] to
                    them&#x2013;they have not the strength, the <lb/>[?] and perseverance, which
                    their new situation <lb/>[?]. The emigrant is not prepared to meet the
                    <lb/>difficulties[?] which the climate, new manner of living, <lb/>[?] or
                    vermin, may bring upon him; and which, <lb/>[?] of all his exertions, may
                    frequently destroy <lb/>[?]. It is, therefore, the greatest cruelty to <lb/>[?]
                    the matter partially; and, while the advantages <lb/>[?] from the old to the new
                    world are drawn <lb/>[?] most fascinating colours, to conceal the priva<lb
                        break="no"/>[?] and sacrifices which must be made, and the <lb/>[?] of
                    failure which may be opposed to <lb/>of success.</p>
                <p>We[?] shall have occasion to prove, by the most un<lb break="no"/>[?] the
                    evidence, that Upper Canada offers to emi<lb break="no"/>[?] advantages, vastly
                    superior to any portion of <lb/>[?] United States; but we would still admonish
                    <lb/>[?] thinking to leave their native country, <lb/>[?] the matter with severe
                    minuteness, not <lb/>[?] away by golden dreams; and to prepare <lb/>[?] should
                    they decide upon going, to meet <lb/>[?] [?] from sickness, from different
                    <lb/>[?], [?] labour, and privations of various <lb/>[?] Yet though no step can
                    be so important as <lb/>[?] leaving one native's country for ever, it is to
                    <lb/>[?] that such a step is taken without due con<lb break="no"/>[?]. The fancy
                    is deluded with goldren dreams; <lb/>farmers[?] in America are owners of the
                    soil on <lb/>[?] they live; they have no rents to pay, no tax<lb break="no"/>[?]
                    their doors; possessing a noble indepen<lb break="no"/>[?] they acknowledge no
                    superiority but genius <lb/>[?]. These are high sounding things, but <lb/>[?]
                    than solid. Before a man allows him<lb break="no"/>[?] deluded by them, he
                    should remember, <lb/>[?] no great hardship to pay rent, if his pro<lb
                        break="no"/>[?] three times the price in England that it <lb/>[?] America;
                    that the difficulty of bringing <lb/>[?] to maret, a tax, not perhaps inferior
                    <lb/>[?] he had paid at home, and attended with <lb/>difficulties[?] which he
                    never experience; that <lb/>[?] of intercourse by good roads and canals,
                    <lb/>[?] time, and the tear and wear of his car<lb break="no"/>[?] amd cattle
                    are worth a very considerable sum; <lb/>in removing from his native country, he
                    is <lb/>[?] the improvements of a thousand years, to en<lb break="no"/>[?] all
                    the rudeness of nature; that he is risking <lb/>[?] happiness, and that of his
                    children, by a <lb/>[?] [?] be retraced, and plunging into <lb/>[?] whose manner
                    and habits are differ<lb break="no"/><cb/>
                    <lb/>ent from his own; and that he will have every thing <lb/>to learn in the
                    midst of strangers.</p>
                <p>When a man has, after mature deliberation, de<lb break="no"/>termined to
                    emigrate, which various considerations <lb/>may, in particular cases, render
                    prudent, his next <lb/>question is, Where shall he go&#x2013;to the United
                    States <lb/>or to Canada? We shall suppose the persons emi<lb break="no"
                    />grating to be friends to the British constitution; for <lb/>if they are not,
                    there is no question; because level<lb break="no"/>lers and democrats will find
                    themselves in a bad <lb/>situation in coming to Canada, as they will find no
                    <lb/>kindred spirits there. But though we can willing<lb break="no"/>ly spare
                    such as these, to lose good subjects is a <lb/>serious evil to the empire; and
                    to lose them through <lb/>ignorance, and the want of that information which
                    <lb/>it is in our power to give, is a folly, as well as <lb/>all evil.</p>
                <p>I am persuaded, that all emigrants, of the descrip<lb break="no"/>tion we
                    mention, would rather prefer to remain un<lb break="no"/>due their own
                    government, than to live under and <lb/>swear allegiances to another, provided
                    no greater <lb/>sacrifices were required in going to the one than to <lb/>the
                    other. I am indeed quite certain, that many <lb/>would consent willing to a
                    considerable sacrifice <lb/>for this advantage, so agreeable to their feelings
                    and <lb/>habits; but we shall shew that no such sacrifice is <lb/>required, and
                    that their interest, as well as inclina<lb break="no"/>tion, when duly
                    considerd, will lead them to Upper <lb/>Canada.</p>
                <p>In going to the United States, we have Mr. Birk<lb break="no"/>beck's authority,
                    that 'no good settlement can be <lb/>made cast of the Alleghany mountains, or in
                    the <lb/>Atlantic States.' The lands are now so dear, as to <lb/>be in general,
                    far beyond the reach of common <lb/>emigrants, who have seldom much left after
                    landing <lb/>in America.</p>
                <p>Suppose two families to land in America&#x2013;one at <lb/>New York, or
                    Philadelphia, on the way to Mr Birk<lb break="no"/>beck's settlement; and one at

                <p>From this calculation it is seen, that the settler, <lb/>with his large family,
                    by coming to Upper Canada, <lb/>instead of joining Mr. Birkbeck, even if he
                    purchases <lb/>his lands at the same price, saves 928 dollars, which <lb/>will
                    enable him to clear a large portion of his farm, <lb/>stock it, and build a
                    comfortable house; and if he <lb/>be granted the land, instead of purchasing it,
                    there <lb/>is a further saving of 130 dollars.</p>
                <p>Let us now see what the product at Mr. Birkbeck's <lb/>settlement in the
                    Illinois, and in Upper Canada, will <lb/>command in the market; for,
                    notwithstanding the <lb/>greatness of the first saving in coming to Upper
                    <lb/>Canada, if the markets be inferior it might soon be <lb/>balanced.</p>

                    Birkbeck's book, are <lb/>t50 per cent, above the truth.</p>
                <p>From this table it is manifest, that the produce <lb/>raised in Upper Canada
                    sells at an advance of up<lb break="no"/>wards of 30 per cent on what the same
                    can be sold <lb/>in the Illinois territory, supposing Mr. Birkbeck's <lb/>prices
                    correct, which they are not, being much too <lb/>high. The vast advantage,
                    therefore, in coming to <lb/>Upper Canada, must appear manifest.</p>
                <p>It may by some be said, that the families are too <lb/>numerous, as there are few
                    that consist of ten per<lb break="no"/>sons; but the results will be
                    proportionally the same, <lb/>whatever the number be; and if we suppose them
                    <lb/>to consist of persons in comfortable circumstances in <lb/>their own
                    country, they will commonly bring ser<lb break="no"/>vants with them, by which
                    the average will be still <lb/>greater. But this is of no moment; the difference
                    <lb/>of expense in travelling 500 miles, or 1570, is suf<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ficiently clear.</p>
                <p>We must add, to the disadvantage of Mr. Birk<lb break="no"/>beck's farmer, the
                    dearness of all those articles which <lb/>he has to purchase; for his distance
                    from the sea<lb break="no"/>coast and market operates in two ways to his
                        disad<lb break="no"/>vantage. 'His produce is low, and the goods from
                    <lb/>are dear: the shopkeeper, who is at a great <lb/>distance from the place
                    where the articles he deals <lb/>in are procured, will add to the price, when he
                        dis<lb break="no"/>poses of the, the additional expense of bringing,
                    <lb/>and the time lost in procuring them. To him who <lb/>is obliged to take a
                    journey of 1600 miles to procure <lb/>his articles of merchandize, the cost and
                    trouble must <lb/>be very great; and all this he makes the consumer <lb/>pay.
                    The journey which Mr. Birkbeck's merchant <lb/>is obliged to take is a very
                    serious one, compared to <lb/>that of the merchant of York or Niagara. The
                        lat<lb break="no"/>ter, in consequence of this situation, can trade with
                    <lb/>a smaller capital than the former; because he can <lb/>at any time procure
                    a fresh supply in a few days, <lb/>while the former can lay in a stock of goods
                    only <lb/>once a-year. Now, all these difficulties are to be <lb/>paid for by
                    the farmers and mechanics, who con<lb break="no"/>sume the articles imported;
                    the difference to them, <lb/>in the course of a twelvemonth, by receiving less
                    for <cb/>
                    <lb/>the articles they sell, and paying more for those they <lb/>purchase will
                    be found to be very great.</p>
                <p>'It is not merely the quantum he shall raise, but <lb/>the sun he shall get for
                    it, which constitutes the <lb/>farmer's advantage. It is not simply to get
                    enough <lb/>to eat and drink that is to bound the desires of the <lb/>farmer; it
                    is to procure the means of converting his <lb/>log-cabin into a handsome and
                    convenient house&#x2013; <lb/>to erect a large barn for his grain, and suitable
                        build<lb break="no"/>ings for his cattle&#x2013;to educate his
                    children&#x2013;and, <lb/>as he grows old, to enjoy the satisfaction of finding
                    <lb/>that his industry has supplied the comforts of life, <lb/>and enabled him
                    to satisfy the wants of society&#x2013; <lb/>wants to which we are indebted for
                    amelioration <lb/>of mankind.'</p>
                <p>In the selection of a place to residence in a new <lb/>country, it is very
                    important to take into view the <lb/>ultimate market for the farmer's produce.
                    While <lb/>the country is settling, there will be no difficulty; <lb/>for the
                    increasing population will demand all the <lb/>supplies that can be raised. But
                    the prudent set<lb break="no"/>tler will look beyond that period, and consider
                    what <lb/>he shall do when every one raises more grain than <lb/>he will be able
                    to consume. In that case, vicinity <lb/>to market, and facility of
                    transportation, are all im<lb break="no"/>portant. Now, the produce of Upper
                    Canada can <lb/>be sent to Montreal, one of the best markets in A<lb break="no"
                    />merica in five or six days, at a trifling expense, <lb/>which is yearly
                    diminishing as the waters are im<lb break="no"/>proved. Very different is the
                    case with the farmer <lb/>in the western division of the United States: the
                        im<lb break="no"/>mense distance which grain has to be sent, occasions
                    <lb/>the expense to be so great, as frequently to equal, and <lb/>sometimes
                    exceed, the price offered when it reaches <lb/>the market. The more that this
                    statement is exa<lb break="no"/>mined, the more correct it will be found, and
                    the <lb/>superior advantages of Canada will appear in a strong<lb break="no"/>er
                    light; but, having been a landholder, it is time <lb/>to instruct the emigrant
                    how he is to make his living <lb/>out of it.</p>

                <p>Among the emigrants proceeding to seek ano<lb break="no"/>ther country on the
                    shores of Southern Africa, <lb/>four vessels, containing above 600 souls, have
                    <lb/>sailed from Liverpool, bound to the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope; three of them
                    under the command <lb/>and direction of a naval officer, and one under
                    <lb/>private superintendance. The public agent was <lb/>instructed to provide
                    every accomodation which <lb/>could minister to the health or comfort of the
                        fa<lb break="no"/>milies who were to embark</p>
                <p>Thursday afternoon, the brig Alexander <lb/>sailed from Greenock with emigrants
                    for Prince <lb/>Edward's island. This vessel had 85 pas<lb break="no"/>sengers
                    on board, of which 17 were children.</p>
                <p>On Friday the ship Alexander, Young, sailed <lb/>from Greenock for Quebec with 96
                    passengers.</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated in Perth, Upper <lb/>Canada, 18th January &#x2013;
                    "Liberty and Equality <lb/>are the predominant principles here. A common
                    <lb/>labourer from Scotland is entitled to a lot of <lb/>land. Whenever he finds
                    he can subsist upon <lb/>his farm, he becomes as high as the best in the
                    <lb/>township. Every settler, though ever so poor, <lb/>has a vote for the
                    member for the township, <lb/>and has full liberty to speak at every meeting.
                    <lb/>&#x2013; It is nothing uncommon to see a poor Glasgow <lb/>weaver, who came
                    among us with scarce a stitch <lb/>to cover his nakedness, strutting between the
                    <lb/>stumps of his trees as pompous as an Ediburgh <lb/>Magistrate."</p>

                        Distress of the Labour<lb break="no"/>ing Classes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Salus populi suprema lex.</p>
                <p><hi rend="enlarged-capital">T</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">here</hi> wasa time when
                    it was held pure factiousness to <lb/>doubt whether the prosperity we enjoyed
                    during the first ten <lb/>or twelve years of the late war, was perfectly sound
                    and na<lb break="no"/>tural, and whether it would not ultimately entail upon us
                    a <lb/>corresponding share of future calamity. But the most gloomy
                    <lb/>anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the pic<lb break="no"
                    />ture on the dark side have certainly come infinitely short of <lb/>the full
                    measure of distress and misery which have at length <lb/>fallen upon the
                    country. It would be unjust to charge the <lb/>Government with any more of these
                    evils than might have <lb/>been foreseen ; but now that they force themselves on
                    the at<lb break="no"/>tention on all sides, it is perfectly fair to hold the
                        Govern<lb break="no"/>ment accountable for all that it can remove or
                    prevent, and <lb/>yet suffers to exist. This is the first time, we believe, in
                        mo<lb break="no"/>dern history, when the evil of an excess, of population
                    has come <lb/>so distinctly under the notice of a Government as to call for
                    <lb/>a legislative remedy. The case is therefore new, and the <lb/>course to be
                    pursued is the less obvious ; but the war was a <lb/>season of bold experiments,
                    in which we surmounted many <lb/>difficulties once deemed insuperable : and if
                    timidity tie up our <lb/>hands now, when humanity calls upon us to move, the
                    world <lb/>may well say, that the boasted energy of the Government has <lb/>been
                    entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of <lb/>the pockets of the
                    people, but that, when a period of public <lb/>calamity requiress exertions of a
                    more painful kind, it is start<lb break="no"/>led by the smallest difficulty,
                    and will not even make such <lb/>a slight effort as might evince its sympathy
                    with the sufferers.</p>
                <p>During the late war, the industry of the country was stimu<lb break="no"/>lated
                    into a state of unprecedented activity, by the monopoly <lb/>we obtained of the
                    commerce of the world&#x2013;by thirty or forty <lb/>millions of the capital of
                    the country being annually melted <lb/>down and consumed&#x2013;and by the
                    continual rise of prices pro<lb break="no"/>duced by the depreciation of the
                    currency. The great de<lb break="no"/>mand for labour, arising out of this state
                    of things, with the <lb/>consequent increase of wages, caused a rapid
                    augmentation in <lb/>the numbers of the people. In the ten years ending 1811,
                    the <lb/>rate of increase in Britain was such as would have doubled the
                    <lb/>population in fifty-two years; and in the great manufacturing
                    <lb/>districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony. <lb/>When
                    the peace came, and was followed by the destruction of <lb/>our commercial
                    monopoly, the cessation of the annual loans, <lb/>and the diminuition of the
                    paper issues, the sources of our fic<lb break="no"/>titious prosperity were
                    dried up at once : a vast reduction took <lb/>place in the demand for labour ;
                    profits and wages fell with <lb/>prices ; while the pressure of the taxes were
                    doubled, and one<lb break="no"/> third added to their real amount by the rise in
                    the value of <lb/>money. The laws, however, which regulate the multiplication
                    <lb/>of human beings, cannot instantly bend to circumstances : a <lb/>long
                    period necessarily elapses before the population accom<lb break="no"/>modates
                    itself to the diminished demand for labour, and dur<lb break="no"/>ing this
                    period the labouring classes must suffe extreme mi<lb break="no"/>sery. In this
                    state we are at present, and time, from which <lb/>we hoped relief, has only
                    aggravated the evil. There are but <lb/>three remedies upon which any dependence
                    can be placed <lb/>&#x2013; a reduction of taxation &#x2013; a change in our
                    commercial <lb/>system &#x2013; and emigration. We have little hopes as to the
                    first, <lb/>since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the Govern<lb
                        break="no"/>ment of its own interest, real or supposed, which we see no
                    <lb/>disposition to make. A relaxation in our restrictive commer<lb break="no"
                    />cial system has not the same obstacles to encounter, and we <lb/>have repeated
                    shewn that it would be highly beneficial. The <lb/>reluctance of Ministers to
                    attempt a change that may prejudice <lb/>the interest of some particular
                    classes, might be considered as <lb/>a prudent caution, were it not observed,
                    that when, instead of <cb/>
                    <lb/>relieving the distress of the people, the object is to suppy the
                    <lb/>necessities of the Treasury, none of this caution appears, but <lb/>the
                    complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar cla<lb break="no"/>mour.
                    But the crisis is now such, that tenderness to the in<lb break="no"/>terests of
                    a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at <lb/>large. Though we shall
                    preach free trade to other nations ra<lb break="no"/>ther with a bad grace, when
                    we can no longer hold our mono<lb break="no"/>poly, it is so far well that our
                    misfortunes are at last likely to <lb/>open our eyes to truths whch were
                    familiar to philosophers <lb/>half a century ago. In our present circumstances,
                    we may <lb/>perhaps almost be thankful, that a systematic error, which has
                    <lb/>impeded our career, has kept this one resource open to us.</p>
                <p>Emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a re<lb break="no"
                    />dundant population, that we are rather surprised there should <lb/>be much
                    reluctance to have recourse to it. We need not <lb/>be afraid that the practise
                    will continue longer than the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity which produces it. " The
                        <hi rend="italic">vis intertiae</hi> of people in ge<lb break="no"/>neral,
                    says <hi rend="smallcaps">Malthus</hi>, and their attachment to their homes,
                    <lb/>are qualities so strong and general, that we may rest assured <lb/>they
                    will not emigrate, unless, from political discontents or ex<lb break="no"/>treme
                    poverty, they are in such a state, <hi rend="italic">as will make it as

                        difficul<lb break="no"/>ties that attend emigration upon a large scale, but
                    these are <lb/>partly occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclu<lb
                        break="no"/>sively to our own colonies. We have vast multitudes, whom
                    <lb/>we can neither feed nor employ ; and surely the first and most
                    <lb/>pressing object is to send them where they will find the means <lb/>of
                    subsistence. There are many parts of the world besides our <lb/>own colonies
                    open to receive them. And whether they go to <lb/>the United States, Brazil,
                    Buenos Ayres, or to Canada, New <lb/>Holland, or the Cape of Good Hope, the
                    advantage to this <lb/>country will be nearly the same. Among so many countries
                    <lb/>of such extent, it would not be very difficult to dispose of half <lb/>a
                    million of persons (young and old) within the course perhaps <lb/>of two years.
                    But upon whatever scale emigration is conduct<lb break="no"/>ed it must be
                    gradual; and this renders it the more important <lb/>to fix upon a plan early.
                    Ministers have lately announced <lb/>that Canada cannot receive more emigrants
                    at present with<lb break="no"/>out inconvenience. But had the intention of
                    sending great <lb/>numbers to that colony been made public two years ago, corn
                    <lb/>would have been raised for them, and men of some capital, <lb/>assured of
                    finding abundance of labourers, would have gone <lb/>out and settled, and
                    provided employment for those who have <lb/>not the means to establish
                    themselves as farmers. The alarm <lb/>we feel of seeing manufactures raised up
                    in other countries by <lb/>the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill
                    founded. Many <lb/>other advantges must be combined with the possession of
                    <lb/>mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish ; and when the <lb/>former
                    are found, able workmen will not be long wanting. Our <lb/>capital, our improved
                    means of internal communication, our <lb/>coal fields, our laws for the
                    protection of industry and proper<lb break="no"/>ty, the free, enlightened and
                    active spirit of our people, with the <lb/>powers of combination resulting from
                    the union of so many <lb/>advantages within so small a space, are better
                    securities for <lb/>our superiority in manufactures, than attempts, which must
                    be <lb/>nugatory, to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent. <lb/>But
                    the opinion which exists in foreign countries, as to the su<lb break="no"
                    />periority of our people in every branch of industry, will have <lb/>this good
                    effect, that it will secure out emigrants a favourable <lb/>reception. Though
                    the emigration, to afford any sensible re<lb break="no"/>lief to the whole
                    country, would require to be upon an exten<lb break="no"/>sive scale, it is yet
                    obvious, that even upon the smallest scale <lb/>it is beneficial. If six
                    labourers are withdrawn from a small <lb/>village, or fifty from a country town,
                    the situation of either <lb/>will be improved. The plan hitherto acted on by
                    Government <lb/>of givingassistance to those only who could raise ten on fif<lb
                        break="no"/>teen pounds, is chiefly objectionable, because it must restrict
                    <lb/>the emigration within very narrow limits. If by sending away <lb/>men who
                    are still able to subsist by their labour, others now <lb/>living on charity get
                    employment, we are in effect relieved of <lb/>so many paupers. But the former
                    are less disposed to leave <cb/>
                    <lb/>the country ; and with regard to those who are or must soon <lb/>become
                    paupers, it will certainly be found more economical to <lb/>pay ten or fiften
                    pounds each to send them abroad, than to <lb/>maintain them permanently home. It
                    is in vain, however, <lb/>to look to private charity for the funds necessary for
                    such an <lb/>undertaking. These must be raised by the country at large ;
                    <lb/>and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose, or mo<lb break="no"
                    />ney destined for other objects be applied to this, the country, <lb/>we have
                    no doubt, is ready to make the sacrifice. Suppose that <lb/>even so great a sum
                    as five millions were required, this is but <lb/>the half of what England alone
                    pays every year for poor rates ; <lb/>and what is such a sum, if it were to
                    afford certain relief on <lb/>an emergency lke the present? If the French and
                    Dutch should <lb/>again disagree about the navigation of the Scheldt, or if we
                    should <lb/>quarrel with the French or Americans about the traffic in a few
                    <lb/>hundred wild cat-skins on the other side of the globe, how <lb/>easily
                    would a sum ten times as large be found? Nothing <lb/>more is requisite than to
                    take on half of the sum for two <lb/>years, which Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Vansittart</hi> allots for paying off the nation<lb break="no"/>al debt. We
                    not only conceive that it would be wise and <lb/>creditable to divert a part, or
                    the whole of the actual Sinking <lb/>Fund to this purpose ; but we go so far as
                    to think, that it is lit<lb break="no"/>tle less than disgraceful to pay off any
                    debt at all at this crisis <lb/>with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving
                    population. <lb/>Whatever is done, it is of vast importance to understand, that
                    <lb/>the most pressing evil, though not absolutely permanent in its <lb/>nature,
                    cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years. <lb/>We have not only an
                    excess of population to dispose of, but <lb/>we have to check the principle of
                    increase, which is rapidly <lb/>aggravating the evil. In the five years ending
                    1810, the po<lb break="no"/>pulation of England added one-seventieth part to its
                    numbers <lb/>annually ; and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same
                    <lb/>for the whole empire, each year must have had 250,000 indi<lb break="no"
                    />viduals more to provide for than the preceding. Till the <lb/>whole of this
                    vast annual inrease is got rid of, the present <lb/>excess of numbers will not
                    diminish but augment. And how <lb/>is it to be got rid of? Either the annual
                    births must diminish <lb/>more than one-third, or famine and disease must
                    destroy a <lb/>quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the u<lb
                        break="no"/>sual rate of mortality, or these two causes must operate toge<lb
                        break="no"/>ther. Notwithstanding, therefore, the misery of the labouring
                    <lb/>classes at this moment, we doubt whether the population is <lb/>not still
                    on the increase, and whether still more afflicting <lb/>scenes are not awaiting
                    us. Indeed, unless measures are taken <lb/>to do away the factitious stimulus
                    which the English poor<lb break="no"/> laws give to the increase of population,
                    the most abundant e<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>migration will prove but a feeble palliative. These are rather
                    <lb/>discouraging circumstances ; but the evil must be dealt with in <lb/>some
                    way, or it will ultimately overwhelm us. It has now be<lb break="no"/>come
                    rather a question of humanitiy than of policy. One or <lb/>two millions of human
                    beings have been suddenly deprived of <lb/>their means of subsistence by events
                    over which they had no <lb/>control. With such a mass of individuals goaded to
                        despera<lb break="no"/>tion by want&#x2013;a deficient crop,&#x2013;a sudden
                    revulsion in trade&#x2013; <lb/>a more general exclusion of our manufactures by
                    the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans,&#x2013;any of those numerous casualties, in short
                    to which e<lb break="no"/>very nation is exposed, would place us in a situation
                    frightful <lb/>to contemplate. Plots and insurrections will keep up a con<lb
                        break="no"/>tinual alarm. Neither persons nor property will be safe, and
                    <lb/>capital will gradually leave the country. If theory were silent,
                    <lb/>experience must now convince us, that time alone will produce <lb/>no
                    material amelioration in our circumstances ; and the relief <lb/>which is may
                    ultimately bring, will be obtained only through <lb/>the destruction of vast
                    multitudes by famine and disease. In <lb/>the fifth year of peace, it is now
                    time to look the evil in the <lb/>face, and either to make some great sacrifices
                    for its removal, <lb/>or to brace our minds to bear the dreadful alternative. It
                    is <lb/>in vain to disguise the matter to our own consciences. Those <lb/>who
                    propose to leave things to what they call the course of <lb/>nature, are in
                    substance recommending that thousands of their <lb/>fellow-creatures should be
                    suffered to rot away from the effect <lb/>of absolute want. That such a thing
                    should take place in the</p>

                <p><pb n="4"/> Extract of a letter received from Calcutta, dated <lb/>22d November,
                    1819:--"An afflicting circumstance <lb/>has recently taken place. The Captain of
                    the Bengal, <lb/>a Liverpool trader, very lately gave a ball on board <lb/>his
                    ship, which was about to sail for England. The <lb/>party was very small, and
                    more than half were taken <lb/>ill with a violent fever immediately afterwards.
                    I <lb/>buried the Captain and the Surgeon a few days after <lb/>it; not less
                    than ten of the part died within as many <lb/>days, all younger persons. Only
                    one officer survives <lb/>of those who left England in the ship, and he is just
                    <lb/>recovering in the Hospital. All sorts of conjectures <lb/>were made, but it
                    turns out that there were 17,000 <lb/>undressed buffalo horns in the hold, in a
                    complete <lb/>state of putrefaction. This vessel has sailed for Eng<lb
                        break="no"/>land in this state without a Surgeon. I question <lb/>whether it
                    will ever arrive; it ought not to be ad<lb break="no"/>mitted among other
                    shipping if it does;&#x2013;the opening <lb/>of the hold will be death to him
                    who does it, and per<lb break="no"/>haps to many more."--In consequence of this
                        disas<lb break="no"/>trous information, Ministers have issued an order for
                    <lb/>the vessel, on her arrival at Liverpool, or any other <lb/>part, to undergo
                        quarantine.&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">London Paper.</hi></p>
                <p>All apprehension on the above subject is complete<lb break="no"/>ly done away by
                    the following letter from Liverpool, <lb/>May 14:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"I noticed a paragraph in the London papers, <lb/>respecting the Bengal, of this
                    port, at Calcutta, stat<lb break="no"/>ing that a number of deaths had taken
                    place, sup<lb break="no"/>posed in consequence of the Infectious vapours arising
                    <lb/>from some buffalo horns.&#x2013;The Bengal arrived here <lb/>April 5, and
                    has been discharged without any of <lb/>those dreadful consequences which the
                    medical gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen of Calcutta prognosticated.&#x2013;I should
                    rather <lb/>suppose that the fatal consequences which ensued <lb/>to those
                    individuals who attended the ball given on <lb/>board this vessel at Calcutta,
                    would be none justly <lb/>attributed to the exposure to night air."</p>

                <p>The following is an extract of a private letter <lb/>dated</p>
                <p>"Halifax, May 22 <lb/>"At two o'clock this day the Earl of Dal<lb break="no"
                    />housie, Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief <lb/>of British North America,
                    attended by the Ad<lb break="no"/>miral, his Majesty's Council, the staff, naval
                    and <lb/>military officers, and the principal people of the <lb/>place, attended
                    to lay the first stone of a new <lb/>college, to be erected at the north end of
                    the <lb/>grand parade. The whole of the freemasons of <lb/>Halifax went in grand
                    procession. They formed <lb/>in lodges at their hall, and, preceded by a
                    military <lb/>band, and followed by another, they marched to <lb/>the places
                    prepared for them on the building.</p>
                <p>"His Lordship came on the scaffolding at <lb/>two o'clock, the grenadiers of the
                    62d regiment <lb/>being his guard of honour. Detachments from <lb/>each regiment
                    kept the ground.</p>
                <p>"After a prayer by the Rev. Mr Twining, <lb/>Grand Chaplain, Lord Dalhousie
                    addressed the <lb/>assembly in a speech, of which I have not time <lb/>to give
                    an outline ; but in it his Lordship men<lb break="no"/>tioned, that the building
                    was intendeed as a college <lb/>upon the plan of that of Edinburgh, where all
                    <lb/>students who professed the Christian religion <lb/>were eligible for
                    admittance. Strangers residing <lb/>here for a short time might also enjoy the
                        bene<lb break="no"/>fit of the institution, and gentlemen in the army,
                    <lb/>the navy, and the military establishments. His <lb/>Lordship concluded a
                    most eloquent and ani<lb break="no"/>mated address with his fervent wishes for
                    the <lb/>welfare and prosperity of the undertaking.</p>
                <p>"A bottle with coins, and a tin case with <lb/>parchments, &amp;c. were then
                    severally deposited in <lb/>the recess made for them, and the stone was
                    <lb/>lowered into its place with all the requisite and <lb/>due forms, under a
                    royal salute from fort Char<lb break="no"/>lotte ; after which the Rev. the
                    Grand Chaplain <lb/>closed the proceedings with a prayer, and the <lb/>whole
                    assembled multitude gave nine cheers.&#x2013; <lb/>The military and masonic
                    processions then re<lb break="no"/>turned in the same order, in which they
                    came.</p>
                <p>The day was beautiful, and a greater as<lb break="no"/>semblage of people was
                    never witnessed in Hali<lb break="no"/>fax.</p>
                <p>"The Countess of Dalhousie and her two sons, <lb/>Mrs Admiral Griffith and the
                    Misses Wilson, and <lb/>most of the fashionable ladies here witnessed the
                    <lb/>ceremony from a convenient scaffolding prepa<lb break="no"/>red for
                    them.</p>
                <p>"Lord Dalhousie purposes to leave Halifax <lb/>for Quebec in his Majesty's ship
                    Newcastle, on <lb/>the 1st of June, without waiting for Sir James
                    <lb/>Kempt."</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Court of Chancery</hi>&#x2013;June 10.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Will of the Late Duke of Queensberry</hi>
                    <lb/>Mr Head stated, that he had to present a petition from <lb/>the annuitants
                    and legates of the late Duke of Queens<lb break="no"/>berry, praying that a
                    fourth more of their claims might be <lb/>paid, there now being sufficient funds
                    in the hands of the <lb/>Accountant-General for that purposes. The Learned
                        Coun<lb break="no"/>sel said, that there was no less a sum than L.1,400,000
                    <lb/>accumulated and vested in the name of this officer, in <lb/>Bank stock, for
                    the benefit of the claimants, and he un<lb break="no"/>derstood it was not
                    intended to oppose the application, al<lb break="no"/>though the executors did
                    not say they would give their <lb/>consent to it. Some consultation had been had
                    on the <lb/>subject out of doors ; he therefore prayed that the prayer <lb/>of
                    the petition should be granted.</p>
                <p>The Attorney-General said, he had not received any in<lb break="no"/>structions,
                    nor had he been consulted.</p>
                <p>The several King's counsel in Court spoke in behalf of <lb/>their respective
                    clients.</p>
                <p>Mr Wingfield appeared for the Earl of Yarmouth, and <lb/>said his Lordship was
                    anxious that the business should be <lb/>put in a train of settlement.</p>
                <p>The Lord Chancellor said, there was not a man existing <lb/>that had a heart in
                    him but must wish the legacies and <lb/>annuities to be paid ; but, said his
                    Lordship, the Marquis <lb/>of Queensberry has commenced an action for the
                    recovery <lb/>of L.150,000 against the executor, and he certainly had a
                    <lb/>right so to do it ; it was, therefore, proper that the Court <lb/>should
                    see that no harm arose to the executors, before the <lb/>funds were allowed to
                    go out of Court. With respect to <lb/>their not opposing the petition, that was
                    very different to <lb/>consenting to it ; it merely said to the Court, " Mind
                    you <lb/>do right."</p>
                <p>Mr Heald said, if his Lordship thought that one-fourth <lb/>was too much, they
                    would take an eight, or any part his <lb/>Lordship pleased.</p>
                <p>The Lord Chancellor.&#x2013;I will order it to stand first on <lb/>the paper for
                    Tuesday next, and in the mean time I will <lb/>look over the petition.</p>

                <p><pb/>India</p>
                <p>We have great pleasure in publishing the following <lb/>interesting letter from
                    India: &#x2013;</p>
                <p>"Madras, Feb. 4, 1820. <lb/>"I have, thank God, no very brilliant events to
                    <lb/>communicate to you, but if the happiness of man is the <lb/>legitimate
                    object of all Government, it is good to learn <lb/>that British India is at
                    peace, and that a temperate <lb/>and radical reform is gradually going on under
                    the <lb/>Marquess of Hastings' administration. The establish<lb break="no"/>ment
                    of schools, and a free press, are the moving prin<lb break="no"/>ciples by which
                    this great advancement in the state of <lb/>society will be accomplished, unless
                    checked by im<lb break="no"/>pious powers.</p>
                <p>"On the subject of these schools, it is not necessary <lb/>here to dilate.
                    Suffice it to observe, that it is in the <lb/>power of any Government, abitrary
                    or free, to educate <lb/>the great bulk of its subjects, and thereby to advance
                    <lb/>them in knowledge, civilization, and happiness, in <hi rend="italic"
                        >the</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">shortest</hi> possible period.</p>
                <p>"The establishment of a <hi rend="italic">free press in Asia</hi> is, in my
                    <lb/>estimation, as useful and magnanimous an art as ever <lb/>adorned the
                    biography of any Statesman. What, say <lb/>its detractors, is setting loose a
                    parcel of printer's devils <lb/>so great an act? No, but setting loose all the
                        intel<lb break="no"/>ligence of the age to work upon the public mind and
                    <lb/>conduct, is an act of unrivalled benevolence. Be it <lb/>asserted that a
                    free press is only applicable to an ad<lb break="no"/>vanced state of society, I
                    deny the position ; it is not <lb/>founded in reason or experience. I contend on
                    the <lb/>other hand, that where least knowledge and msot evil <lb/>exist, there
                    is the greatest scope for improvement ; and <lb/>I offer Scotland as a proof of
                    the efficacy[?] of education <lb/>and a free press.</p>
                <p>"The Marquess of Hastings, Governor General of <lb/>India, has, in the newspapers
                    of Madras and Calcutta, <lb/>been accused of having sent two persons of the name
                    of <lb/>Hastings, to <hi rend="italic">unhealthy</hi> climates, the one to the
                    East <lb/>and the other to the West Indies, where they <hi rend="italic">died
                        ;</hi>
                    <lb/>and for the <hi rend="italic">base</hi> purpose of securing to his family
                    the <lb/>title of Huntingdon. This, you must be aware, was <lb/>touching his
                    sensitive honour to the quick ; and it <lb/>would seem as if some one inimical
                    to a free press, had <lb/>introduced the paragraph to irritate him. But this
                    <lb/>virtuous man, who would not tread on an insect, al<lb break="no"/>lowed
                    this shameful slander to pass unnoticed. It stood <lb/>refuted in every bosom,
                    and his manly forbearance <lb/>tended but to give further proofs of his
                    attachment to <lb/>our infant liberty. Attacks have likewise been made <lb/>on
                    Sir E. East, our Chief Justice. He complained, <lb/>they say, of these alleged
                    libels to the Chief Magistrate, <lb/><hi rend="italic">who desired him to have
                        recourse to the law</hi> Conceive <lb/>not, however, that I am the advocate
                    for a licentious <lb/>press. My maxim is, that a great power, when mis<lb

                    beneficial, in proportion to its strength.</p>
                <p>"You will rejoice to learn that Mr Elphinstone, <lb/>Governor of Bombay, has done
                    away with the Censor<lb break="no"/>ship of the Press. This wise Statesman,
                    being a friend <lb/>to freedom, and having <hi rend="italic">experienced</hi>
                    the benefits which <lb/>had arisen in Bengal from the measure (for scarce a

                    adopted it the moment he came into <lb/>power, and thus proved himself a public
                    benefactor.</p>
                <p>"To conclude, it is my firm conviction, that the <lb/>diffusion of knowledge,

                <p>A vessel, the Prompt sailed on Tuesday evening <lb/>from Greenock for Quebec,

                    deg. by the ship William, on a <lb/>voyage from Monte Video for Valparaiso. The

                    <lb/>of seals an whales were found in its neighbourhood. <lb/>He has named the
                    island New Shetland.</p>
                <p>Accounts from Constantinople, dated May 26, an<lb break="no"/>nouce, that the
                    armaments against Ali Pacha are upon <lb/>the most formidable scale, and are

                </p>
                <p>Accounts have beenreceived from Buenos Ayres, <lb/>by the Blossom sloop of War,
                    of a curious nature.&#x2013; <lb/>They relate to a project said to have been in
                    agitation for <lb/>placing a Prince of the House of Bourbon at the head <lb/>of
                    an independent Sovereignty on the River Plate.&#x2013; <lb/>The circumstance has
                    been brought to light by the late <lb/>changes in the Government of Buenos
                    Ayres. From <lb/>the documents now published, and received by the <lb/>Blossom,
                    it appears that in June, 1819. Gomez the <lb/>Envoy from Buenos Ayres, at Paris,
                    was invited to a <lb/>conference by M. De Cazes, then French Minister for
                    <lb/>Foreign Affairs, the object of which was to communi<lb break="no"/>cate a
                    project of the French Cabinet for the colonsolida<lb break="no"/>tion of the
                    Independent Government of South Ame<lb break="no"/>rica.</p>
                <p>This project, the French Minister observed, would <lb/>meet with the decided
                    approbation of the Continental <lb/>Powers, especially Russia and Austria. Great
                    Britain <lb/>might not like it, but yet would not find any good pre<lb
                        break="no"/>tence for resisting it ; and his Catholic Majesty would
                    <lb/>yield to the influence of all Europe with the better <lb/>grace, as his
                    former dependencies would be only trans<lb break="no"/>ferred to a branch of his
                    own family. The King of <lb/>France would furnish assistance of every king, and
                        em<lb break="no"/>ploy every means, even to the supply of troops, for car<lb
                        break="no"/>rying the affair into execution.</p>
                <p>On the 26th of October last, when the statement of <lb/>his conference reached
                    Buenos Ayres, Rondeau, then <lb/>Director <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi> made
                    a secret communication to <lb/>the Congress, and transmitted to them the letter
                    of the <lb/>Envoy, together with the French memorial ; on the <lb/>following
                    day, and on the 3d of November, the matter <lb/>was discussed in secret
                    meetings, and the result was an[?] <lb/>opinion, that the Constitution
                    lately-sworn allowed <lb/>no alteration to be made in the form of Government
                    <lb/>till after the meeting of the Chambers. That a branch <lb/>of the Bourbon
                    family, so closely connected with the <lb/>reigning Monarch of Spain, was in
                    itself an insuperable <lb/>objection, as also the consideration that the Prince
                    <lb/>proposed and supported by the Powers of the Euro<lb break="no"/>pean
                    Continent, would naturally more incline towards <lb/>the views of his protectors
                    than towards those of South <lb/>America, which ought to avoid all connexion
                    with Eu<lb break="no"/>ropean continental politics ; and that Great Britain was
                    <lb/>the power from which South America had most to <lb/>fear, and most to
                    expect.</p>
                <p>It was at the same time suggested, that the Envoys in <lb/>Europe shoud put the
                    communications from Paris in<lb break="no"/>to the hands of the British Minstry,
                    whose good opi<lb break="no"/>nion and protection South America is most anxious
                    to <lb/>conciliate.</p>
                <p>Our Cabinet has always treated the South Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans with the
                    greatest reserve, as if feating contamina<lb break="no"/>tion by simple
                    contact&#x2013;a delicacy towards Spanish in<lb break="no"/>terests and feelings
                    which appears in itself commenda<lb break="no"/>ble, but, when measured by the
                    standard of national <lb/>benefit, may not merit the same praise. As it is, it
                    <lb/>would seem that the British interest is likely to gain <lb/>the ascendacy
                    in the river Plate, rather through the <lb/>disposition of the inhabitants, than
                    from any influence <lb/>exerted by our Ministers.</p>
                <p>We shall only add, that thought the negotiation was <lb/>carried on by the Duke
                    de Cazes, the project did not <lb/>originate with him, and did not at first
                    apply to the <lb/>Prince de Lucca. It was intended as an opening for <lb/>one
                    more nearly allied to the reigning family in <lb/>France.</p>

                <p>We cannot give publicity to the above return, with<lb break="no"/>out observing
                    how eminently calculated such a docu<lb break="no"/>ment is, to open the eyes of
                    our too credulous, yet in<lb break="no"/>dustrious and loyal countrymen ; many
                    of whom are <lb/>still disposed to look to the United Statesm, as the abode
                    <lb/>of independence and the source of affluence. Here we <lb/>see nearly 2000
                    British subjects, who, in one season, <lb/>through the agency alone of one of
                    our Consuls(with<lb break="no"/>outany pecuniary aid), have removed from the
                    United <lb/>States to Upper Canada. Their trieal and failure in <lb/>the former,
                    as well as the trial and failure of the great <lb/>numbers who have returned to
                    this country, are circum<lb break="no"/>stances well calculated to direct the
                    attention of those <lb/>who have emigration in view, at once to Upper Cana<lb
                        break="no"/>da. We have made enquiry about these hitherto un<lb break="no"
                    />known, but truly fertile regions ; and we are informed <lb/>from a most
                    authentic and satisfactory source, that there <lb/>there are unlocated lands,
                    fertile beyond the conception of <lb/>those who have not seen them, capable of
                    receiving ten <lb/>millions of inhabitants ; that the winters are not so
                    <lb/>cold, nor the summers so hot, as in the State of New <lb/>York ; that these
                    regions have proved eminently healthy <lb/>to the vast numbers that have poured
                    into them of late <lb/>years ; and that the administration of the laws, the
                    <lb/>state of education and religious instruction, and above <lb/>all, the peace
                    and quiet of the inhabitants have found there, <lb/>have exceed their most
                    sanguine expectations.</p>
                <p>It may be desirable to state, that grown persons can get <lb/>by water from
                    Quebec to York, the capital of Upper <lb/>Canada, for about 28s ; children, half
                    price ; that to <lb/>all persons properly recommended as to good conduct, <lb/>a
                    grant of land is given according to their means of <lb/>cultivation ; that this
                    grant becomes their own for ever, <lb/>and they may dispose of it as they
                    please.</p>

                <p>"An opportunity having offered for transmitting <lb/>a hasty account of the
                    Aurora and Brilliant transports, <lb/>proceeding with settlers to the Cape of
                    Good Hope, I <lb/>feel happy in availing myself of that circumstance, <lb/>with
                    a view as well to gratify our friends in England, <lb/>as to add another
                    confirmation of the liberality of Go<lb break="no"/>vernment in our important
                    undertaking. First, it will <lb/>be necessary to state, that the two ships sail
                    in compa<lb break="no"/>ny, and are every day within hail of each other ; the
                    <lb/>former commanded by Captain Pearson, and the latter <lb/>by Captain
                    Bothwell, who is accompanied by Lieute<lb break="no"/>nant Pritchard, as agent
                    to both vessels.</p>
                <p>"We sailed from Gravesend on. Our <lb/>course down Channel was most favourable,
                    and the <lb/>weather has hitherto been propitious. No death, <lb/>disease, or
                    serious accident has occurred in either ship <lb/>and blooming health and vigour
                    now rapidly succeed the <lb/>langour produced by a sudden transition to a new
                        ele<lb break="no"/>ment. Provisions, consisting of flour, currants, suet[?]
                    <lb/>oatmeal, peas, butter, cheese, tea, sugar, biscuit, salt <lb/>pork, and
                    beef, of excellent quality, are liberally sup<lb break="no"/>plied, together
                    with a proper allowance of rum, vine<lb break="no"/>gar, mustard and spices. The
                    ships are fitted up in <lb/>every respect comfortably and commodiously, and the
                    <lb/>most perfect harmony prevails, if we except bickerings <lb/>amongst the old
                    women about fractured teapots and <lb/>mislaid culinary articles. The attention
                    paid to the <lb/>comfort of the passengers, and more especially to that <lb/>of
                    the women and children, by the Captains, and the <lb/>agent (Mr Pritchard), is
                    highly creditable to the in<lb break="no"/>structions received from
                    Government.</p>
                <p>"Although I do not sail in the same ship Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Bothwell. I have
                    had ample proofs of the kind<lb break="no"/>ness and humane liberality which he
                    shews to the pas<lb break="no"/>sengers in the Brilliant. Captain Pearson is an
                    active, <lb/>intelligent officer, who has been 23 years in the Tran<lb
                        break="no"/>sport Service under Government : he has sailed to al<lb
                        break="no"/>most every part of the world, and Algoa Bay, our <lb/>place of
                    destination, is quite familiar to him.</p>
                <p>"It may be egotism to speak of myself; but I trust <lb/>I may be excused in
                    boasting, that of the crew and <lb/>240 passengers, not one is seriously
                    indisposed at present, <lb/>and wishing, with heartfelt sincerity, to my friends
                    in <lb/>England, happiness, peace, and tranquility, in as good <lb/>health as I
                    now enjoy, long may they live, long live the <lb/>Constitution: and while on
                    Fish River or Orange Ri<lb break="no"/>ver we encounter the difficulties
                    incident to new colo<lb break="no"/>nists, may England and South Africa be ever
                    united <lb/>by the ties of mutual friendship&#x2013;the one affording her
                    <lb/>parental arms, and the other mindful of her filial duty. <lb/><hi

                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>We have received letters and papers, from the Cape <lb/>of Good Hope, to the 22d
                    October, and they are sa<lb break="no"/>tisfactory in all points of view, but
                    especially with re<lb break="no"/>ference to the new settlement at Algoa Bay.
                    His <lb/>Excellency, the Governor, Sir R. S. Donkin, was <lb/>taking some
                    effectual measures to place the coinage <lb/>of the colony upon a better
                    footing, and on the 13th <lb/>of October he issued a Proclamation for destroying
                    a <lb/>very large quantity of base money. He has also taken <lb/>measure to
                    communicate to the new settlers from <lb/>England the full benefit ofthe Courts
                    of Justice es<lb break="no"/>blished in that quarter of the world.</p>
                <p>We have received an account of the loss of the A<lb break="no"/>beona[?]
                    transport, bound to the Cape of Good Hope, <lb/>with settlers. The following is
                    an extract of a letter <lb/>from the Agent to Lloyd's, dated Lisbon, 20th Dec.
                    <lb/>"The Condessa da Ponte, which arrived on the 20th <lb/>inst. from
                    Marenham[?], has brought 49 persons, who <lb/>escaped from the Abeona transport,
                    bound to the Cape <lb/>of Good Hope, which took fire and was burnt on the
                    <lb/>25th ult. in lat. 5 N. long&#x2013;and 113 lives were lost. <lb/>The Agent,
                    Lieut. Madge, the Captain, Surgeon, 21 <lb/>men, 16 boys, 4 women, and 5 girls,
                    got into three <lb/>boats, and fortunately fell in with the Condessa da
                    <lb/>Ponte, the morning after the fatal event."</p>
                <p>Demerara Gazettes to a late date have been received, <lb/>which give detailed
                    accounts of the number and state <lb/>of the slaves in that part of the West
                    Indies. The re<lb break="no"/>port is given by James Robertson, Esq. the new
                    Slave <lb/>Registrat of the United Colony. It is a triennial <lb/>statement of
                    the slave population, and the Reporter <lb/>makes some judicious comparative
                    remarks. It ap<lb break="no"/>pears that there has been a large decrease of the
                        num<lb break="no"/>ber by deaths, but the Creoles are greatly increased as
                    <lb/>compared with the former year. Births have been in <lb/>the proportion of
                    one to forty-six. The Report de<lb break="no"/>fends the [?] of the West India
                    Planters, and ob<lb break="no"/>serves that the state of the Black population
                    serves[?] <lb/>to evil for little or no [?] ; so great is the <lb/>kindness, the
                    liberality, and induglent care of pro<lb break="no"/>piertors. It adds, that
                    their own interests is a perpe<lb break="no"/>tual[?] evil[?] upon their

                    <lb/>&#x2013;The following extract of a letter from Bombay <lb/>bringing this
                    intelligence, we copy from Carrick's <lb/>Post, which appears to have exclusive
                    means of obtain<lb break="no"/>ing information on India affairs:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"Bombay, Sept. 12, 1820. <lb/>"While I was seeing the last of your goods on
                    <lb/>board, last night, a vessel arrived in the harbour hav<lb break="no"/>ing
                    on board an officer from Cutch, who was the hear<lb break="no"/>er of the
                    official intelligence of the complete success <lb/>of Sir Charles Culville's
                    expedition against the Sin<lb break="no"/>deans. The expedition consisted of
                    12,000 men, <lb/>commanded by his Excellency the Commander in <lb/>Chief ; from
                    all I could clean of intellience from the <lb/>followers, it appeared there had
                    been some hard fight<lb break="no"/>ing for five days ; but it ended, as might
                    be anticipat<lb break="no"/>ed, from the imposing force sent against the
                    Sindeans. <lb/>The moment the officer (who is one of the Staff, and <lb/>an
                    Irishman) landed, he set out for the Government <lb/>House, to inform Lady
                    Colville of the event, as it <lb/>must be supposed she was in a state og
                    anxiety, her <lb/>husband being the commander, and her brother, and <lb/>her
                    uncle, Colonel T. Blair, being also on the expe<lb break="no"/>dition. At
                    day-light this morning orders arrived from <lb/>the Government House, to secure
                    a passage and pri<lb break="no"/>vate cabin for the officer in th ship which
                    takes this <lb/>to England, but there was no such accomodation, as <lb/>the
                    cabins were all full ; and as another vessel will not <lb/>sail from thence
                    about ten days, this and will be off <lb/>to-day, the chance is, you will have
                    this letter at least <lb/>six weeks before the officers can reach England with
                    <lb/>the official intelligence. All kinds of European pro<lb break="no"/>duce
                    are a drug hee, paricularly fine goods ; and <lb/>rum, brandy, and geneva, are
                    for a song. The cho<lb break="no"/>lera has rather abated, but still rages in a
                    frightful <lb/>manner."</p>
                <p>The Rio Janeiro packet arrived on Tuesday with let<lb break="no"/>ters to the
                    21st of November. Advices had been re<lb break="no"/>ceived from Rio Grande,
                    stating that Artigas had been <lb/>taken prisoner. The Portuguese frigate,
                    Union, had <lb/>captured two insurgent privateers which had been com<lb
                        break="no"/>mitting depredations on the coast. The events in Por<lb
                        break="no"/>tugal, owing to which, as well as to the idea that the <lb/>King
                    would be prudent enough to sanction what had <lb/>taken place in Portugal, the
                    prices of produce had ex<lb break="no"/>perienced very trifling alteration,
                    though, if the con<lb break="no"/>trary should be the case, a considerable rise
                    was anti<lb break="no"/>cipated. The following relates to what is passing in
                    <lb/>Peru :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro, dated Novem<lb break="no"/>ber 20
                    :&#x2013;" The Chilians have at length carried into <lb/>effect their boasted
                    expedition, which left Valparaiso <lb/>on the 21st August, and arrived at Pisco
                    at the begin<lb break="no"/>ning of September. San Martin landed 4,500 men,
                    <lb/>but the blacks, cattle, &amp;c. had all been previously sent <lb/>away from
                    the estates in that quarter, so that they will <lb/>be disappointed in meeting
                    with partisans ; indeed the <lb/>slaves and lower orders, whom they expected to
                    find <lb/>favourable to their views, are the most irritated against <lb/>the
                    insurgents. We have letters from Lima to the 12th <lb/>September, which speaks
                    of the little apprehensions en<lb break="no"/>tertained of San Martin and his
                    troops, the Viceroy <lb/>having a formidable force, in the capital and vicinity,
                    <lb/>of 8,000 men, commanded by good officers. The <lb/>Viceroy, is
                    Commander-in-Chief, La Serna, second, <lb/>and La Mar and O'Reilly command
                    divisions. They <lb/>were observin San Martin's movements who already
                    <lb/>experienced the difficulties of subsisting his men. The <lb/>Marquis of
                    Vallembrozo was on his flank, with a <lb/>strong detachment of cavalry, with a
                    view to prevent <lb/>him from sending emissaries into the interior, and col<lb
                        break="no"/>lecting horses. It is thought the insurgents will soon <lb/>have
                    to re-embark ; for, as soon as they are a little <lb/>pressed for provisions,
                    and fighting comes on, num<lb break="no"/>bers will desert. Those who have
                    already come over <lb/>describe their situation as very critical. Two vessels,
                    <lb/>one an English, and the other a French, were prepar<lb break="no"/>ing to
                    sail from Callao for this place, and by them we <lb/>shall receive further
                    particulars. The most enthusias<lb break="no"/>tic preparations were making in
                    Lima to proclaim the <lb/>constitution in a formal manner, for which purpose
                    <lb/>orders had been received from Madrid. This of itself <lb/>is sufficient to
                    defeat all views Cochrane and San Mar<lb break="no"/>tin may have on the
                    country, except, as before, a lit<lb break="no"/>tle plunder on the open and
                    defenceless parts of the <lb/>coast.</p>
                <p>Letters from Sierra Leone, dated the 24th of Nov. <lb/>mention that the whole
                    squadron was lying there.&#x2013; <lb/>The Pheasant, Myrmidon, Snapper, and
                    Thistle, were <lb/>lying off the Cape, waiting for the Morgiana to com<lb
                        break="no"/>plete her water, provisions, &amp;c. which ship was oblig<lb
                        break="no"/>ed to be assisted by the squadron, in consequence of <lb/>her
                    very sickly state. She had recently arrived from <lb/>the River Gambia, whither
                    she had proceeded in dread <lb/>of attack by the natives on our infant colony
                    there. <lb/>A letter of thanks had been voted to Captain Finlason, <lb/>by the
                    merchants of that colony, for the very able man<lb break="no"/>ner in which he
                    brought to an amicable conclusion the <lb/>differences between the Native Chiefs
                    and the British <lb/>interests in the Gambia. The Morgania brought from <lb/>the
                    Gambia, Dr Dochard and forty-six men belong<lb break="no"/>ing to the mission
                    under Major Gray, for exploring <lb/>Africa. Dr D. had been at Sago ; but, in
                        conse<lb break="no"/>quence of internal wars, he was unable to proceed
                    <lb/>further. Major Gray was there with very few men ; <lb/>he will not proceed
                    further for some time.</p>

                <p>Sierra Leone Gazettes to the 16th of December have <lb/>been received. It is
                    satisafactory to learn that some <lb/>more effectual measures, than any before
                    adopted by <lb/>the French Government, to prevent slave trading are <lb/>now in
                    a course of execution. The French brig of <lb/>war, Le Huron, of 22 guns,
                    Commodore Du Pres<lb break="no"/>sit, is employed in cruizing for that

                    <lb/>has been a scene of horror and destruction at Zante.&#x2013; <lb/>At four
                    o'clock, on the morning of the 29th of Dec. <lb/>we had a violent shock of an
                    earthquake, which lasted <lb/>nearly half a minute ; this was followed by eight
                    other <lb/>shocks, between four and six o'clock, which threw <lb/>down one
                    thousand three hundred houses. Providen<lb break="no"/>tially, the first shock
                    did not throw down many, so <lb/>that the inhabitants had time to escape before
                        succeed<lb break="no"/>ing shocks, otherwise theloss would have been
                        dread<lb break="no"/>ful. Only ten lives have been lost, but not a house
                    <lb/>in the town has escaped without some injury. The <lb/>town is still in a
                    complete state of confusion ; one <lb/>thousand give hundred houses more, being
                    so much in<lb break="no"/>jured as to be marked in order to be pulled down ; all
                    <lb/>the steeples in the place must be taken down. The <lb/>streets are almost
                    impassable from the fallen houses ; <lb/>and great caution is required, in
                    walking, to avoid the <lb/>ruins that are still falling.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The following is an extract of a letter from a tradesman <lb/>belonging to
                    Glasgow, who has been six years in Upper Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, to a friend in
                    this city :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="italic">York, Upper Canada, 14th November</hi>, 1820. <lb/>"You wish
                    to be informed of the encouragement that you <lb/>might meet with by an
                    emigration to this country; and as <lb/>you have determined to place the most
                    implicit confidence <lb/>in what I may advance. I shall therefore state to you
                    the <lb/>"truth, and nothing but tl[?] truth, so help me <hi rend="italic"
                        >God</hi>."&#x2013; <lb/>In the first place, you wish to know what might be
                    the va<lb break="no"/>lue of a hundred acres of land, with six or eight acres of
                    <lb/>improvement. This is a question that I cannot give a de<lb break="no"
                    />cided answer to, as it depends entirely on the situation <lb/>where you wish
                    to purchase; but I may with safety aver<lb break="no"/>age wild land, in this
                    Upper Province, say at 4 to 6 dol<lb break="no"/>lars per acre, and the clearing
                    or improving of each acre <lb/>will cost you from 16 to 20dollars.&#x2013;In the
                    next place, you <lb/>wish to know the price of cattle. They have never been
                    <lb/>known to be cheaper than at the present time. A cow can <lb/>be purchased
                    at 20 dollars, a pair of working oxen at 40 <lb/>dollars; a good cart horse at
                    50 dollars,; sheep, 2 dollars a<lb break="no"/> piece. In regard to farming
                    utensils, there are but few <lb/>used in this country at any time, and a new
                    settler may be <lb/>some years in the woods before we want any more than an
                    <lb/>axe, (3 dollars) a plough, (10 dollars) and a harrow, (5 dol<lb break="no"
                    />lars.)&#x2013;You wish to know the nature of a Government <lb/>grant; that has
                    now become no object, as the charges made <lb/>by Government exceed in many
                    cases what you can pur<lb break="no"/>chase land for; and by buying land you
                    have the advan<lb break="no"/>tage of choosing a situation agreeable to your
                    mind; but <lb/>the reverse is the case when you accept of a grant from Go<lb
                        break="no"/>vernment, for you must then take your chance by drawing <lb/>by
                    lottery; and as the land is already taken up for forty <lb/>miles round this
                    place, you will then be obliged to go back <lb/>into the woods, and out of the
                    world. You are at liberty <lb/>to sell it as soon as you receive the grant;
                    formerly you <lb/>could.&#x2013;You wish to know what sum you could estab<lb
                        break="no"/>lish yourself for in this country as a farmer. There is one
                    <lb/>thing obvious&#x2013;the more you bring the less miseries and
                    <lb/>difficulties you will have to undergo. But as a true friend, <lb/>I would
                    advise you not to think of leaving home with a <lb/>sum less than t200 sterling
                    with a sum less than this you <lb/>undoubtedly subject yourself to hardships and
                    troubles <lb/>that you have no idea of. Though many have settled here <lb/>for
                    nothing, their fate has been such that it is beyond my <lb/>pend to describe;
                    and my greatest enemy I should not ad<lb break="no"/>vise to come to this
                    country, with the intention of farming, <lb/>with less capital than I have no
                    stated to you. Many <lb/>may flatter you, and stuff your head with golden dreams
                    <lb/>about this country; but you must allow the experience that <lb/>I have had
                    to outweigh the statements of many that you <lb/>may have had an opportunity of
                    talking with, who may pre<lb break="no"/>tend to have some knowledge of this
                    country, for there <lb/>are but few settlements between Montreal and the falls
                    of <lb/>Niagara (a distance of nearly 600 miles,) that I have not
                    <lb/>visited.&#x2013;As to the necessaries wanted for a family who may
                    <lb/>think of coming to this country, I should entirely confine <lb/>myself to
                    wearing apparel, as clothes are the highest article <lb/>in this country; and
                    should you think of farming, I would <lb/>advise you to bring but few fine
                    clothes, but principally <lb/>coarse and stout. Heavy luggage of any kind
                    becomes very <lb/>expensive and cumbersome bringing you up the river so far as
                    <lb/>this, and is often liable to be damaged, in consequence of <lb/>the
                    repeated re-shipping. The rate of charge of the trans<lb break="no"/>portation
                    of good from Montreal to Kingston (200 miles) <lb/>is 2 dollars per cwt.; and
                    from Kingston to York (200 <lb/>miles) they charge 1 dollar for each barrel
                    bulk; and from <lb/>Montreal to York you may get a passage for 10 dollars for
                    <lb/>each grown person.&#x2013;By the by, you wish to know the po<lb break="no"
                    />pulation of this town: it is indeed small in comparison to <lb/>some of your
                    towns; but I might say that the inhabitants of <lb/>York might amount to 3000
                    people. But there is no place <lb/>that I have visited in my travels that is
                    more thriving than <lb/>this town; and as a proof, I can safely say that it is
                    now <lb/>twice the size that it was when I came here, (now three <lb/>years),
                    and still continuing to increase greatly in buildings; <lb/>but all
                    wood.&#x2013;You wish to know the different branches of <lb/>business carried on
                    here. They are principally house car<lb break="no"/>penters; and various other
                    mechanics are also employed <lb/>here.&#x2013;You wish to know if any of the
                    emigrants have ar<lb break="no"/>rived in this place. There are but very few I
                    understand <lb/>come thus far, the greater part of them having stopped at a
                    <lb/>settlement called Perth, about miles below Kingston. <lb/>&#x2013;Since I
                    have now given answers to all your different <lb/>queries, let me now give my
                    candid opinion respecting this <lb/>country. In the first instance, a farmer may
                    live by hard <lb/>labour; that is, he may acquire a livelihood; but cash[?] is a
                    <lb/>complete hidden treasure, and is as forbidden fruit to the <lb/>farmer of
                    this country; and in some places you may live <lb/>for years and not even
                    behold, a silver dollar through a glass <lb/>darkly, as all is done by barter in
                    the country. The next <lb/>evil is the mixture of society; a very few good,
                    intermixed <lb/>with a multitude of a very different character; but in many
                    <lb/>places you will be divested of all society, either of a good <lb/>or bad
                    quality; in either of which situations I am afraid you <lb/>will find yourself
                    uncomfortable, in consequence of its <lb/>being so much different to what you
                    have been accus<lb break="no"/>tomed to; and the opportunity of spending the
                    sabbath <lb/>in a religious worship you will also find wanting. And <lb/>above
                    all evils the fever and ague, that none escape, is <lb/>the ruin of many a
                    family in this country. But should <lb/>you think of coming to this country, in
                    order to avoid this <lb/>disease I would advise you to come no farther up the
                        coun<lb break="no"/>try than Perth settlement, where this loathsome sickness
                    <lb/>is seldom known. Now, my friend, by what I have stated <lb/>here I neither
                    mean to advise or dissuade you from com<lb break="no"/>ing to this country; but
                    take it into serious consideration <lb/>before you embark upon this
                    important."</p>

                </p>
                <p>This day his Excellency the Governor in Chief made the <lb/>following[?] speech
                    to both Houses:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen <lb/>of the House of
                    Assembly,</p>
                <p>"When the Parliament met for the dispatch of public <lb/>business[?], I did
                    entertain a hope that the experience of the <lb/>[?] few years would have led
                    you to a mature and serious <lb/>consideration[?] of the consequences that would
                    inevitably <lb/>follow[?], if the then state of things should not be remedied ;
                    <lb/>I[?] cannot therefore be surprised that I should now ex<lb break="no"
                    />press[?] not only my disappointment, but great concern that <lb/>[?] same
                    question of constitutional principle should have <lb/>[?]ia disturbed the
                    unanimity of your legislative proceed<lb break="no"/>ings[?].</p>
                <p>"Upon this occasion I think it a duty which I owe to <lb/>[?] and to your country
                    to call upon you to consider, du<lb break="no"/>ring[?] this summer, the result
                    of the discussions of the ses<lb break="no"/>sesion[?] in all its bearings.</p>
                <p>"You will see the administration of the civil govern<lb break="no"/>ment[?] left
                    without any pecuniary means but what I shall <lb/>advance[?] upon my own
                    personal responsibility ; you will <lb/>[?] individuals suffering under severe
                    and unmerited hard<lb break="no"/>ships[?], caused by the wast of that
                    constitutional authority <lb/>that[?] is necessary for the payment of the
                    expences of the <lb/>civil[?] government. You will see the interior improve<lb
                        break="no"/>ments[?] of the country nearly at a stand ; you will see, in
                    <lb/>[?]ort, the executive government in a manner palsied and
                    <lb/>powerless[?].</p>
                <p>"When I shall again summon you to meet here in Par<lb break="no"/>liament[?], you
                    will come to decide the important question, <lb/>whether[?] the Government shall
                    be restored to its constitu<lb break="no"/>tional[?[ energy, or whether you are
                    to deplore the prospect <lb/>[?] lasting misfortune, by a continuance in the
                    present state <lb/>[?] things. Important as that question is, there can be no
                    <lb/>difficulty[?[ in the decision. When the blessingsof the Bri<lb break="no"
                    />tish[?] constitution were granted to this province, you re<lb break="no"
                    />[?]ved with it the recorded experience of centuries of <lb/>[?]ctise. There is
                    no question of doubt or of difficulty <lb/>[?]that may not find its precedent in
                    the records of the Im<lb break="no"/>[?]Imperial Parliament ; and I cannot thik
                    that any wiser <lb/>[?]guide need by desired."</p>
                <p>After which, the Honourable Speaker of the Legislative <lb/>[?]council said, that
                    it was the pleasure of his Excellency the <lb/>[?]Governor in Chief that the
                    Provincial Parliament should <lb/>[?] prorogued until Thursday, the 26th of
                    April next.</p>

                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>We have received Canada Papers to the 10th May. <lb/>The active exertions of the
                    Governor to improve the <lb/>inland navigation had given very general
                    satisfaction. <lb/>In the course of the Session of the Colonial Parlia<lb
                        break="no"/>ment, which was prorogued on the 14th April, no less <lb/>than
                    three Addresses were presented to Earl Dalhou<lb break="no"/>sie, to be
                    forwarded to the King ; one respecting the <lb/>allowance of half-pay to the
                    Militia ; another respect<lb break="no"/>ing the duties imposed in British ports
                    on lumber from <lb/>Canada ; and third related to the losses sustained <lb/>by
                    the people of Canada, during the late war. His <lb/>excellency the Governor had
                    intimated, that no objec<lb break="no"/>tion would be made to the repeal of the
                    grant of 2,500l <lb/>on account of the Civil List for the Colony, provided
                    <lb/>the salaray of the Chief retired Justice, the Receiver<lb break="no"/>
                    General, and that of the Speaker of the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly,
                    should be continued, in the whole amounting <lb/>to 1,800l. The grant has for
                    some time been a pro<lb break="no"/>minent subject of complaint in the Colonial
                        Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>The 37th Regiment for three years stationed in <lb/>Lower Canada is about to
                    leave the Colony for Eng<lb break="no"/>land. The Staff Corps was to proceed to
                    the Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, to carry into effect the intended plan for removing
                    <lb/>the obstructions in that river.</p>
                <p>An article from Montreal, dated May 5, states, that <lb/>a messenger was leaving
                    that place to announce the <lb/>union of the North and Hudson's Bay Compa<lb
                        break="no"/>nies, at their respective establishments. The former <lb/>of
                    these companies was under control of Lord Sel<lb break="no"/>kirk, and the
                    schism that has so long reigned between <lb/>them, with its fatal consequences,
                    is well know to <lb/>the Public.</p>
                <p>By Letters from Bombay we learn that 20 ships <lb/>have been taken up by the
                    vigilant Governor, on board <lb/>of which 5000 troops are embarked, destined to
                    the <lb/>Persian Gulph, to repair the disaster suffered by the <lb/>surprise of
                    the detachment left by Sir Wm. Kier, un<lb break="no"/>der the direction of a
                    young man. The gallant Gen. <lb/>Lionel Smith has been selected for this
                    important ser<lb break="no"/>vice ; and we have no doubt but that he will
                    convince <lb/>the Arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceed<lb
                        break="no"/>ings, and justify the high confidence which the Go<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>vernment of Bombay have in his talents and valour.&#x2013; <lb/>His
                    Excellency Mr. Elphinstone, completely recover<lb break="no"/>ed, is gone on a
                    tour to Kutch, to settle all disputes, <lb/>and to ascertain the true situation
                    of the country.&#x2013; <lb/>How important it is for the Heads of the
                    Presidencies, <lb/>thus to judge from actual observation, instead of trust<lb
                        break="no"/>ing to mere reports. This proves the benefits of ap<lb
                        break="no"/>pointing men of experience and energy in the conduct <lb/>of our
                    Indian Empire&#x2013;which is now, throuh the <lb/>admirable conduct of the
                    Governor General, and the two <lb/>other Presidencies, in a state of unexampled,
                        tranqui<lb break="no"/>lity and prosperity.</p>

                    and nothing to fear ; the assist<lb break="no"/>ance given to settlers liberal,
                    and grants of land to the a<lb break="no"/>mount of from 400 to 2000 acres given
                    them, generally of ex<lb break="no"/>cellent quality. This colony in fact is the
                    only country that <lb/>an Englishman should come to, he neither changes climate
                    <lb/>not habits, for here every thing hat occurs to him is the <lb/>same, except
                    burning wood for coals. The country on the <lb/>sea coast is very woody, but
                    much easier cleared than Ame<lb break="no"/>rica and about ten miles in the
                    interior several miles of ex<lb break="no"/>tent have no wood at all. The ships
                    behaves beautifully, sails <lb/>well, and is easy ; we have never close reefed
                    and not above <lb/>twice double reefed, and not strained a rope yarn nor
                    <lb/>split a sail."</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter received by My Leyden, <lb/>R. N. Leith, from his Son, Mate
                    of the ship <lb/>Skelton, dated Sullivan's Cove, off Hobart Town, <lb/>29th
                    November 1820 :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"I take this opportunity of sending you a few lines by the <lb/>ship Guildford,
                    which is to sail tomorrow for Baravia, and <lb/>then homewards. We left the
                    Table Bay on 18th October, <lb/>and arrived here on 28th November, making a very
                    good <lb/>passage. Did not see any vessel on the passage&#x2013;made the
                    <lb/>island of Amsterdam and St Paul's on 28 November&#x2013;went <lb/>ashore on
                    the island of Amsterdam for two or three hours, <lb/>found it to be barren
                    entirely&#x2013;only inhabited by give or six <lb/>people from the Isle of
                    France, for the purpose of sealing. <lb/>When we came near the land, fell in
                    with various winds <lb/>and calms&#x2013;made the river on Sunday about twelve
                    o'clock, <lb/>and brought up off Hobart, at three P M on Monday. The
                    <lb/>country has a very fine prospect, a great deal of wood, but
                    <lb/>interspersed with fields all in green, for it is the spring here
                    <lb/>now&#x2013;the pease are in full bloom. This town is very irregu<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>larly built, just like a Norwegian village&#x2013;a deal of wooden
                    <lb/>houses&#x2013;the appearance of the country pleases the eye greatly <lb/>of
                    the passengers, and the visit they had from the Deputy <lb/>Governor was very
                    favourable. Governor M'Quarrie is to <lb/>be here from Sidney in the course of a
                    fortnight or three <lb/>weeks to survey the Government works. The passengers
                    <lb/>are in great suspense whether they will forward themselves <lb/>to Sydney,
                    or wait until he comes. Butter sells at 4s, a lb ; <lb/>coarse ship biscuits
                    35s. a cwt ; a pair of ashets, middle size, <lb/>21s. and every thing in like
                    proportion. Salted pork would <lb/>have sold very well&#x2013;could clear L130 a
                    cwt. Beef is about <lb/>6d. a lb. If you buy any here, and pay in produce, you
                    pay <lb/>more than in hard cash. There are few bush rangers now, <lb/>they were
                    mostly all shot in the woods. No encouragement <lb/>here for pickpockets. Some
                    of the richest and most power<lb break="no"/>ful men here have once been sent
                    out as convicts, but, from <lb/>their good behaviour, got their emancipation.
                    The Midship <lb/>Leith, upon the pier, is here ; he is master of a colonial brig
                    <lb/>trading between Sydney and here. Our passengers tell me <lb/>they can chuse
                    what land they like ; but not the quality ; they <lb/>must apply the saw and the
                    hatchet a great deal. A hatchet <lb/>costs 7s. 6d. a lb. Very few people have
                    female servants, as they <lb/>can't trust them ; as those who come out are
                    convicts, and <lb/>get soon married, so they have all men servants."</p>

                <p>New York, May 8. <lb/>The sloop Hero, Capt. Palmer, arrived at <lb/>Stonington,
                    last Tuesday, in seventy-three days <lb/>from New South Iceland, with a cargo of
                    oil. <lb/>ON the 28th of March, in lat. 21. S. long. 35. W. <lb/>spokethe Brig
                    Wilner, of London, from Buenos <lb/>Ayres, bound to Falmouth, England ; the
                        Cap<lb break="no"/>tain of which informed Capt. P. that the Chilian
                    <lb/>army, near Peru, had fought two battles with the <lb/>Royal army, in both
                    of which the Chilian army <lb/>was victorious ; and it was supposed would cause
                    <lb/>the surrender of Peru soon to the Chilians.</p>
                <p>May 15. <lb/>The gigantic projects that occupy the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of
                    our countrymen are truly surprising. A <lb/>plan is now forming, for example, to
                    establish a <lb/>settlement at the mouth of the river Columbia, <lb/>for the
                    purpose of importing teas direct from the <lb/>East Indies. It is then proposed
                    to transport <lb/>this article of merchandize up the Columbia, un<lb break="no"
                    />til it reaches the rocky mountains, and then to <lb/>proceed by land to the
                    navigable branch of the <lb/>Missouri. This embraces a space of three
                    <lb/>hundred and forty miles in extent. Of this dis<lb break="no"/>tance 200
                    miles are represented by travellers as <lb/>constituting an excellent road ; the
                    remaining <lb/>one hundred and forty comprehend the moun<lb break="no"/>tain
                    barrier, which must be passed by the intre<lb break="no"/>pidity and labour of
                    man. The merchandize <lb/>will then, by the aid of the Missouri and its
                    <lb/>subsidiary streams, supply the whole western <lb/>continent with the
                    refreshing beverage. This <lb/>shows the varied changes of commerse ; the
                    <lb/>Atlantic States have heretofore been the medium <lb/>of supplying our
                    western States with the pro<lb break="no"/>ductions of China ; but if this plan
                    should be <lb/>carried into effect, we may receive our supply <lb/>from that
                    country through the western States.</p>
                <p>May 16. <lb/>It is worthy of remark, that among the nu<lb break="no"/>merous
                    arrivals at this port yesterday, were three <lb/>British brigs from Dundee. This
                    makes good <lb/>the remark of a late Scotch gazette, that <lb/>Dundee was
                    becoming a place of considerable <lb/>trade.</p>

                    <lb/>a Gentlemen belonging to the county of Cornwall, <lb/>and who is an Officer
                    in the service of the African <lb/>Comapny:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>Cape Coast Castle, April 21, 1821. <lb/>By the time you have received this, it is
                    probable the <lb/>African Company will have ceased to exist ; we have
                    <lb/>received orders to hold ourselves in readiness to deliver <lb/>up the
                    Forsts and Settlements here to Government. It <lb/>is understood they are to be
                    put on the same footing as <lb/>Sierra Leone. A list has been furnished to
                        Govern<lb break="no"/>ment by the Company's Committee, of their Officers,
                    <lb/>their age, length of service, the situations they fill ; <lb/>their
                    emoluments[?], &amp;c. We have been blockaded here, <lb/>since the 10th of
                    February, by the Ashantees[?] (an Afri<lb break="no"/>can tribe), who have
                    commenced hostilities against us. <lb/>On the day before mentioned, our Governor
                    received <lb/>intelligence that a black man belonging to Cape Coast, <lb/>where
                    the people are under our protection, had been <lb/>cruelly murdered by a Chief
                    of the Fantes[?], at a place <lb/>about six miles from Cape Coast, called
                    Moree[?]. I was <lb/>immediately ordered to assemble all the soldiers I
                    <lb/>could, in five minutes, and proceed to Moree to seize <lb/>the murderer. I
                    quickly set off with four officers and <lb/>85 soliders. A little before we
                    entered the town of <lb/>Moree, where the savages, between 2 and 3,000 in
                    <lb/>number, were assembled, we saw the mangled remains <lb/>of their unforunate
                    victim. The town stands near the <lb/>top of a hill, on the summit of which is
                    an old Dutch <lb/>Fort. As soon as we entered the town, a fire was <lb/>opened
                    upon us ; but as my orders were to seize the <lb/>murderer, if possible, without
                    bloodshed, I did not for <lb/>some time allow the men to return the fire.
                    However, <lb/>perceiving they were resolved to oppose us, I gave di<lb
                        break="no"/>rections to my little party to give them a volley and <lb/>then
                    to charge. The negroes retired as we advanced, <lb/>and in less than an hour we
                    gained the hill, from which <lb/>our opponents fled in every firection. We
                    demanded <lb/>the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging <lb/>to
                    Moree ; who not being engaged in the affair had re<lb break="no"/>mained, and
                    who immediately gave them up. In the <lb/>fort, which has a draw-bridge, we were
                    perfectly se<lb break="no"/>cure from the attack of the negroes. The body we
                        de<lb break="no"/>feated were Fantees, who were assembled to assist the
                    <lb/>Ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands <lb/>made by them on the
                    people of Cape Coast. As soon <lb/>as the Ashantees, who reside near Cape Coast,
                    learned <lb/>that the Governor had sent an armed force against their
                    <lb/>friends, their drum beat to arms, and they hastened <lb/>after us ;
                    fortunately we had defeated our opponents <lb/>before they arrived. However,
                    they rallied the Fan<lb break="no"/>tees, and took a position about half a mile
                    from the <lb/>town, with a determination to oppose our little party. <lb/>The
                    Governor, apprised of our situation, assembled <lb/>all the forces he could
                    muster, and speedily about 500 <lb/>of the Cape Coast people, headed by our
                    officers, and <lb/>carrying the British flag, were seen approaching. The
                    <lb/>enemy immediatel retired, and we were relieved from <lb/>our disagreeable
                    situation, after having been from nine <lb/>in the morning till four in the
                    afternoon exposed to a <lb/>burning sun, without refreshment. The negroes had

                <p>Extract of a letter to a Lady in the vicinity of <lb/>Chelmsford, dated New
                    Essex, Graham's Town, on <lb/>the frontiers of Africa, June 21,
                    1821:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"I am seven hundred miles from the Cape <lb/>of Good Hope, and should not receive
                    intelligence of <lb/>an arrival there for at least three weeks ; but my cor<lb
                        break="no"/>respondent at Cape Town will procure comfortable <lb/>lodgings,
                    &amp;c. until a ship sails for Algoa Bay, which <lb/>is distant from me one
                    hundred and thirty miles.&#x2013; <lb/>Few ships from England proceed farther
                    than the <lb/>Cape. Good ploughmen are wanted, and good foot<lb break="no"
                    />ploughs, with spare wrought-iron shares and coulters, <lb/>which are very
                    expensive here ; iron-work nothing <lb/>under 1s. per lb. Ransome's ploughs sell
                    for 14l. <lb/>each. Ploughmen will find plenty of employers, at <lb/>from 2l. to
                    8l. per month and their board. Meat <lb/>sells at 2d. per lb ; wheat 12s. bushel
                    ; and bar<lb break="no"/>ley 6s. Other articles of housekeeping are about the
                    <lb/>same price as in England ; but, on the other hand, we <lb/>are in one of
                    the healthiest climates in the world, and <lb/>free from rent, tithes, and taxes
                    of every descrip<lb break="no"/>tion. Any one may live here as well with 500l.
                    as in <lb/>his native land with 5000l. The farming work is still[?] <lb/>done
                    with oxen, which are very fine, and bought at <lb/>3l. each ; cows are 30s. ;
                    and sheep, 6s. a-head (hav<lb break="no"/>ing tails that weight 8lb., a complete
                    lump of fat) ; <lb/>clothes, linen, and all English goods, very dear.&#x2013;
                    <lb/>Good mechanics, of any description, have very high <lb/>wages. A cargo of
                    Ladies would make a good specu<lb break="no"/>lation, in proceeding to the New
                    Settlement ; for all <lb/>that came out with the settlers have got
                    husbands."</p>
                <p>By letters received from the Cape of Good Hope, <lb/>we understand that the Royal
                    African corps was dis<lb break="no"/>banded there on the 26th of June last.</p>
                <p>By letters from Bombay, dated the 24 of May, <lb/>we learn that the Governor, the
                    Honourable Mr. El<lb break="no"/>phinstone, has returned to the Presidency,
                    after a five <lb/>months' tour to the northward. He must minutely <lb/>examined
                    all the judicial and revenue systems&#x2013;furnish<lb break="no"/>ing the
                    Collectors and Agents of Government with par<lb break="no"/>ticular instructions
                    for their guidance. He also sent <lb/>out strong detachments to reduce some
                    predatory hordes <lb/>who have long plundered the country, and been a ter<lb
                        break="no"/>ror to the peaceable natives. Those plunderers are <lb/>are
                    called Bheels[?]. They live in the hills and woods, and <lb/>descend in bands to
                    commit their depredations. By <lb/>these letters we learn, what is essential for
                    young men <lb/>going out to India to know, that Writers and Cadets <lb/>now
                    undergo an examination as to their knowledge of <lb/>the native languages ; and
                    no youth has a chance of <lb/>success who is ignorant of the Hindoustanee[?].
                    The <lb/>highest respect is entertained for the able manner in <lb/>which the
                    disinterested Dr. Gilchrist prepares young <lb/>men for the services. We rejoice
                    to learn that the <lb/>Cholera Morbus has abated its rigour in the Deccan.</p>
                <p>Batavia journals of the 28th April give an account <lb/>of a terrible earthquake
                    which took place on the 29th <lb/>December last, on the south coast of Celebes.
                    It did <lb/>immense damage, especially at Budekomba[?], where <lb/>the sea rose
                    several times to a prodigious height, and <lb/>then falling in with the
                    incredible rapidity, alternately <lb/>deluged and left the shore, destroying all
                    the planta<lb break="no"/>tions from Bontain to Boelekomba[?]. Many hundred
                    <lb/>have lost their lives. The fort of Boelekom-[?] <lb/>ba was much damaged,
                    that of Bontain less so. On <lb/>the 4th of January this year, there was another
                    shock <lb/>of an earthquake, but we do not learn that it did any <lb/>damage. <cb/>
                    <lb/>It is with much regret we lay before our readers the <lb/>following details
                    of a most calamitous fire which broke <lb/>out at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the
                    17th ult. :</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="smallcaps">Halifax</hi>, Sept. 17. <lb/>"The conflagration this
                    morning was one of the <lb/>most awful and destructive every witness in Halifax.
                    <lb/>It originated in Sackville-street, in the Bakery occu<lb break="no"/>pied
                    by Shay and Milany, and before it was discover<lb break="no"/>ed, had gained an
                    alarming height. It was near two <lb/>o'clock when the bells were rung. The
                    troops, sea<lb break="no"/>mean of his Majesty's ships, and inhabitants, soon
                        as<lb break="no"/>sembled ; the engines were judiciously placed, lines
                    <lb/>formed to different reservoirs of water, and every exer<lb break="no"/>tion
                    made to extinguish the fire, but we regret to state, <lb/>that before any check
                    could be given to it, the whole <lb/>block of buildings, with the exception of a
                    house situ<lb break="no"/>ated at the corner of Sackville and Blowers'-streets,
                    <lb/>occupied by Mr H. Croskill, the houses occupied by <lb/>Mrs. Neilson and Mr
                    T. Muirhead, on Barrington<lb break="no"/> street, and a stable belonging to J.
                    W. Johnston, Esq. <lb/>in Granville-street, were consumed.</p>
                <p>"For some time great apprehensions were entertain<lb break="no"/>tained that the
                    fire would extend to the houses on the op<lb break="no"/>posite side of the
                    streets, but fortunately it did not. <lb/>Of the property burnt only about t1500
                    were insured, <lb/>and the calamity has mostly fallen where it will long <lb/>be
                    severely felt&#x2013;upon windows and orphan children&#x2013; <lb/>upon
                    industrious tradesmen, whose whole stock of <lb/>worldly wealth was invested in
                    the tenements they oc<lb break="no"/>cupied.</p>
                <p>"To the troops, and the seamen of the ships of war, <lb/>the town is, as usual,
                    greatly indebted for the exertions <lb/>made by them. Twenty-one houses were
                    consumed, <lb/>with other valuable property."</p>
                <p>America appears to be very unhealthy just now&#x2013; <lb/>The accounts from Long
                    Island, Baltimore, Amelia <lb/>Island, and Norfolk, are extremely calamitous.
                    The <lb/>whole of Amelia Island is a perfect hospital, not one <lb/>family being
                    well, and in many instances not one to <lb/>assist another. So dreadful, indeed,
                    is the disease, <lb/>that there is not one sentinel to do duty. A New <lb/>York
                    Paper of the 30th ult. says&#x2013;</p>
                <p>We are sorry to perceive from the <hi rend="italic">Franklin Gazette</hi>,
                    <lb/>that the malignant fever continues to make serious ra<lb break="no"/>vages
                    among our fellow citizens at Baltimore. Four <lb/>full victims to it in the 24
                    hours ending on Sunday <lb/>morning ; and six during the 24 hours ending Monday
                    <lb/>morning.</p>

                <p><pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>In our last paper, we gave, from the Jamaiza Ga<lb break="no"/>zettes, an account
                    of the dreadful drought which had <lb/>prevailed in that island for more than
                    twelve months <lb/>and the consequences of which had been most calami<lb
                        break="no"/>tous. We are now, however, most happy, in being <lb/>able to
                    state, upon the authority of a Gentleman who <lb/>left Jamaica some days
                    subsequently to the date of our <lb/>preceding advices, that this terible evil,
                    in such a cli<lb break="no"/>mate particularly, had at length ceased. The
                        follow<lb break="no"/>ing is the substance of the information which has been
                    <lb/>communicated to us:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"A few hours previous to my going on board the <lb/>Jamaica packet, on the 3d of
                    September, the rain fell <lb/>in such torrents as to flood the streets of
                    Kingston to <lb/>the depth of two feet, and it seemed to be general
                    <lb/>throughout the district of Liguanea.</p>
                <p>"Though too late to save the crop of sugar for the <lb/>present, or, perhaps, the
                    ensuing year, this seasonable <lb/>change of weather would at least have the
                    effect of <lb/>staying the mortality among the cattle. As such, those
                    <lb/>interested in the island will receive the intelligence <lb/>with
                    gratification. On some properties, the canes had <lb/>been cut as fodder to save
                    the stock."</p>
                <p>We have the Cape of Good Hope papers to the 6th Au<lb break="no"/>gust, and as
                    they are unusually barren in their con<lb break="no"/>tents, it is fair to infer
                    that every thing was proceeding <lb/>there in a satisfactory manner. The only
                    article of <lb/>the slightest interest relates to the change the Governor
                    <lb/>is gradually effecting in the currency, by removing <lb/>from it all the
                    base metal, and substituting gold and <lb/>silver of standard value.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gazette of Dordrecht</hi> publishes accounts from <lb/>Java
                    to the 29th May. They confirm the statement of <lb/>the decrease of the malady,
                    and mention, that it was <lb/>almost wholly subdued in the district of Samarang,
                    <lb/>but that 18,000 persons, mostly Europeans, had fal<lb break="no"/>len
                    victims. Batavia and Sourabaya were still in<lb break="no"/>fected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">India</hi>&#x2013;Extract of a letter from Calcutta, dated
                    <lb/>June 20:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>"If the extension of foreign trading be considered with <lb/>you as a means
                    suited to alleviate the pressure, and ease <lb/>the difficulties of Old England,
                    which we read of here, <lb/>we imagine that India can furnish beneficial
                    openings to <lb/>this kind of remedy. The use of articles of British pro<lb
                        break="no"/>duction and exports is gaining ground rapidly here ; the
                    <lb/>English printed cottons are now carried in considerable <lb/>quantities as
                    far as Rajpootha, and find a ready sale, if <lb/>they be of handsome patterns.
                    The warehouses now are <lb/>so far from being overstocked, that before the
                    arrival of <lb/>two vessels from England in the last fortnight, all Euro<lb
                        break="no"/>pean articles were exorbitantly high ; mustard flour sold
                    <lb/>about 20s. a pound ; cheese 1[?] ; ham, three half crowns <lb/>the ld ; a
                    common round hat, three guineas. These, <lb/>undoubtedly, were prices arising
                    from an unusual scarci<lb break="no"/>ty ; but it surely cannot be so very bad a
                    trading, <lb/>which admits, even, indicidentally, of such an exaggera<lb
                        break="no"/>tion of price and profit. Government bonds are now at <lb/>six
                    per cent premium, though they bear but half the <lb/>usual or legal interest of
                    the country. This is a tolerable <lb/>evidence of the credit of the Company and
                    the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. There is a great and increasing prosperity in
                        Hin<lb break="no"/>dostan. The augmented cultivation of the Upper Pro<lb
                        break="no"/>vinces within these two years is surprising.</p>

                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration</hi>.</p>
                <p>The following is an extract of a letter dated <lb/>Louisville, August 12th, 1820,
                    from a Scotchman <lb/>who has been ong settled in America, to his friend, <lb/>a
                    Scotch Farmer, who rents 500 acres of land in the <lb/>County of Middlesex.</p>
                <p>"The circumstances in which this country is <lb/>placed at present are truly
                    melancholy, when com<lb break="no"/>pared to what they have been ; yet still it
                    is a better <lb/>country to live in than Britain. It is not easy to <lb/>make
                    money by farming, at present, in the United <lb/>States, for the want of a
                    market; and I am of opi<lb break="no"/>nion that things will not mend, in this
                    respect, for <lb/>some years, for all are sellers and none buyers. All
                    <lb/>kinds of produce are selling, or rather offered for <lb/>sale, at one-third
                    of what prices were two years ago. <lb/>Land, of course, has fallen in the same
                    ratio. The <lb/>best of cleared land, within from 5 to 10 miles of <lb/>this
                    town, is offered for them from 10 to 20 dollars an <lb/>acre. You will thence
                    conclude that this is a fa<lb break="no"/>vourable time to purchase &#x2013; and
                    that for a man <lb/>who has a little money, and a large family able and
                    <lb/>willing to labour with their hands, this is a most <lb/>excellent country,
                    as he can easily raise on this cheap <lb/>land all the necessaries, and many of
                    the luxuries, of <lb/>life. He will find it difficult to get gold or silver,
                    <lb/>or even our own bad bank notes; but a man cannot <lb/>be badly off with
                    more beef, mutton, pork and <lb/>grain, than he can dispose of. He has no rent
                    to <lb/>make up by term day: his taxes are next to no<lb break="no"/>thing, and
                    although he may grumble to have to turn <lb/>his pigs into his corn field to
                    save the expense of reap<lb break="no"/>ing it, or to see his apples rotting
                    under his trees by <lb/>barn-fulls because he has not room or use for them,
                    <lb/>yet still these are beatable distresses compared to those <lb/>of the poor
                    farmers in our native land, and as I sup<lb break="no"/>pose in England. To the
                    wealthier farmer the change <lb/>is not beneficial or desirable. It is true that
                    if he <lb/>stays long in Britain he will soon become less weal<lb break="no"
                    />thy; yet still he would for some time regret the change. <lb/>He would miss
                    many things made necessary by habit; <lb/>he would find his servants more lazy,
                    and less obe<lb break="no"/>dient ; and he would even experience pain because
                    the <lb/>modes of farming he is accustomed to will not do <lb/>here; but when he
                    gets over these things, he <lb/>will find the advantage of the change. To say
                        no<lb break="no"/>thing of the difference of the Government, and the sat<lb
                        break="no"/>isfaction of chusing one's own rulers, there are many
                    <lb/>desirable things here. I estimate, as the greatest, <lb/>the ease of
                    providing for one's family. A man may, <lb/>with very little exertion, leave to
                    all his children <lb/>land enough to make them independent. Hence that
                    <lb/>sickening anxiety about the future fate of a family <lb/>is little known
                    here."</p>

                </p>
                <p>"Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colo<lb break="no"/>nial town;
                    6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; <lb/>the whites are about
                    1200 Europeans, and not as many <lb/>born in the country; the rest are blacks
                    and mulattoes. <lb/>Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never
                    <lb/>saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty <lb/>and miserty
                    than in any town of the size in the world.&#x2013; <lb/>There are some few
                    splendid houses, but the rest so dis<lb break="no"/>gustingly filthy that you
                    cannot go into them without being <lb/>covered with dust and vermin. The
                    streets, as in all A<lb break="no"/>merican towns, run at right angles; a
                    powerful stream of <lb/>water in each : the town is capable of great
                    improvement. <lb/>The climate must be bad, for the whole population look as
                    <lb/>if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born
                    <lb/>race&#x2013;melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of <lb/>Peru we
                    made the same observation; the ague very gene<lb break="no"/>ral, with
                    fever&#x2013;their habits and manner of living increase <lb/>the evil: thin
                    clothing and vegetable diet&#x2013;nights very cold <lb/>&#x2013;I sleep under a
                    heavy blanket, and could bear another; a <lb/>thick fog prevents the sun from
                    coming out in winter; the <lb/>heat however is not excessive during summer; on
                    the whole <lb/>not an oppressive climate, if the people had any idea of living
                    <lb/>in a rational way. Very few families cook at home&#x2013;they <lb/>buy
                    their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in pulperias, <lb/>and in the
                    squares: not six families in Lima that have wine <lb/>on their tables: they
                    drink brandy at all hours, and excuse <lb/>themselves for not having any thing
                    that is expensive, by <lb/>saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies
                        him<lb break="no"/>self a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card
                    in <lb/>the evening. Their money goes in gambling, debauchery, <lb/>and dress;
                    every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady <lb/>take no offence at her
                    frailty being exposed; she tells you <lb/>she is quite as good as her
                    neighbours, and needs be no bet<lb break="no"/>ter. The Spanish nation and
                    Government are the cause <lb/>of all the degradation of South America: every
                    Viceroy, <lb/>from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a plunderer, a teacher of
                    <lb/>immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of <lb/>this people
                    seems incredible&#x2013;one must see to believe it : <lb/>scarcely a young lady
                    can read or write, or use a needle; <lb/>few houses that the Devil has not
                    appeared in; and a de<lb break="no"/>vout lady is accompanied in her carriage by
                    the Virgin <lb/>Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves : as to
                    <lb/>priestcraft, it reigns here in all its glory : a third part of <lb/>Lima is
                    covered with churches, some of them very splen<lb break="no"/>did. The whole
                    trade of this part of Peru depends on the <lb/>single mine of the mountain of
                    Pasco for returns : if this <lb/>is worked to advantage, it will produce six
                    millions of <lb/>produce. Mining may be carried to any extent, it is true;
                    <lb/>but this requires tranquility and good government. Peo<lb break="no"/>ple
                    in Europe have the most erroneous ideas of Peru; <lb/>every traveller and
                    historian who has written or talked a<lb break="no"/>bout it ought to be made to
                    stand in the pillory for a liar.</p>
                <p>"Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to <lb/>Upper Peru, is a
                    wretched village of hovels covered with <lb/>mud&#x2013;about 400 Mulattoes and
                    Indians&#x2013;placed on a sand <lb/>bank&#x2013;the pepole all in the
                    ague&#x2013;not a boat or ship of any <lb/>sort. The harbour-master came off on
                    a bulsa, (two blad<lb break="no"/>ders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian.
                    We could not <lb/>get a basket of fruit or vegetables for money. Their culti<lb
                        break="no"/>vation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to
                    <lb/>fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to <lb/>twenty
                    hours, offering them any price for their tropical <lb/>fruits.</p>
                <p>"I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on <lb/>the ground;
                    borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery <lb/>No such thing as a tavern :
                    never was. Letters of no use; <lb/>no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at
                    eight o'clock <lb/>to kill time. A play twice a week : the most fashionable
                    <lb/>ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the
                    <lb/>chandlier; the house filled with smoke.</p>
                <p>"There are 82 titled familes, mostly idiots&#x2013;all reduced <lb/>to poverty by
                    the emancipation of their slaves. If the war <lb/>be continued a year, Peru will
                    be the most wretched coun<lb break="no"/>try on the globe; indeed the Indians
                    will regain their em<lb break="no"/>pire, and exterminate all other colours. The
                    number of <lb/>blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy
                    thousand&#x2013; <lb/>25,000 in Lima and adjacent villages; the total population
                    <lb/>of Peru about three millions&#x2013;three-fourths Indians.</p>
                <p>"About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty <lb/>country houses.
                    Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in <lb/>the greatest variety; fruits of
                    all climates in the market<lb break="no"/>place, the produce of the sea-shore
                    and the Cordillera.&#x2013; <lb/>Beef and mutton excellent&#x2013;the chief
                    supplies come from <lb/>Jauja an other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore
                    <lb/>produce is contiued to little vallies badly cultivated; those <lb/>about
                    the town would disgrace the free negroes of Caro<lb break="no"/>lina. Most
                    valuable land a league from the town, half <lb/>cultivated and half abandoned;
                    every thing left to starved <lb/>slaves; such famished objects I never behald;
                    no other hands <lb/>to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they
                    <lb/>will not work, and famine must ensue. "</p>

                        rend="italic">Hunt</hi> will be taken, in a short <lb/>time, from Hertford
                    gaol, and put on board one of the hulks lying <lb/>off Woolwich, preparatory to
                    his being transported for his natural <lb/>life, by the first convict-ship,
                    which will sail from this country to <lb/>New South Wales.</p>
                <p>The augmentation of the army consists in the formation of two <lb/>regiments, the
                    94th and 95th infantry, and in the intended raising <lb/>of four others, but
                    which will not be embodied for some time. If <lb/>we look at the previous
                    strength of the army of this extended Em<lb break="no"/>pire, the small increase
                    in question will not only excite no alarm, <lb/>but it will be considered
                    absolutely necessary for ordinary purposes. <lb/>The total number of regulars
                    voted for the last year (exclusive of <lb/>the East Indies) was only 71,000,
                    including officers. These may <lb/>be said to be distributed in the following
                    manner :&#x2013;</p>

                    reached us yesterday ; but the So<lb break="no"/>ciety brings so much
                    benevolence into activity, under the <lb/>guidance of practical wisdom, aided by
                    very enlightened <lb/>views of the best interests of society, that we consider
                    any <lb/>delay improper in calling the attention of the public to <lb/>their
                    valuable proceedings. The present Report abounds <lb/>with evidence that they
                    have not relaxed in their exer<lb break="no"/>tions. At home, not only are the
                    laws improving, but the <lb/>magistracy are carrying improvements into all the
                    practical <lb/>departments. A great many jails, designed on much bet<lb
                        break="no"/>ter principlpes, are in progress in different parts of the
                    <lb/>country ; and in those which are used, it may be said, <hi rend="italic"
                        >ge</hi><lb break="no"/><hi rend="italic">nerally</hi>, that much more
                    attentions is paid to health, clean<lb break="no"/>liness, diet, employment, and
                    classification. It must not <lb/>be thought, however, that nothing remains to be
                    done. <lb/>There are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed, <lb/>and
                    chained to the floor of their cels from night to morn<lb break="no"/>ing ;
                    others in which persons committed <hi rend="italic">for trial</hi> are fet<lb
                        break="no"/>tered with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds ;
                    <lb/>and others in which debtors are exposed to the contami<lb break="no"
                    />nating society of criminals, in which neither the various <lb/>classes of
                    prisoners, nor the two sexes, are kept separate <lb/>from each other, and in
                    which all are allowed to be idle. <lb/>The Magistrates of Surrey have provided a
                        <hi rend="italic">covered</hi> vehicle <lb/>for conveying prisoners to the
                    Sessions'house ; but in the <lb/>metropolis, it would appear, the practise still
                    continues of <lb/>inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely
                    <lb/>suspected of crime, by marching them <hi rend="italic">handcuffed</hi>
                    through the <lb/>streets of London ; and, very recently, a party of <hi
                        rend="italic">one hun-</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">dred prisoners</hi> were marched for a mile <hi
                        rend="italic">handcuffed</hi>
                    <lb/>through the open streets, <hi rend="italic">in order to be formally set at
                        liber-</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">ty by proclamation !</hi> So much for metropolitan
                    decorum ! <lb/>These shameful exhibitions and practises cannot, however,
                    <lb/>long maintain their ground ; the publicity given to them, <lb/>through the
                    proceedings of the Society should, of itself, be <lb/>enough to do them away ;
                    but while they are continued <lb/>England should be somewhat chary of her
                    boasts. The <lb/>views and principles of the Prison Society are attracting
                    <lb/>notice and gaining ground in France, Switzerland, the Ne<lb break="no"
                    />therlands, Hanover, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, Denmark, Nor<lb break="no"/>way,
                    Sweden, and Russia. At Christiana the Magistrates <lb/>have already resolved on
                    the erection of a new city gaol. In <lb/>St Petersburgh the prisoners are now
                    furnished with food, <lb/>clothing, baths, and medical assistance. A Ladies'
                        Asso<lb break="no"/>ciation, under the patronage of the Princess <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Mesthersky</hi>, <lb/>is also in full activity at St
                    Petersburgh ; and there is an <lb/>auxiliary prison society at Orel, on the very
                    frontiers of Sibe<lb break="no"/>ria. Seven thousand prisoners passed through
                    Orel last year ; <lb/>but their chains have been lightened, and their condition
                    <lb/>meliorated generally, through the exertions of the Russian <lb/>Society.
                    For details, however, we must refer to the Re<lb break="no"/>port itself ; but
                    we cannot take leave of it without making <lb/>special notice of the benefits
                    conferred on society by <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Female Associations</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Temporary Refuge</hi>. The <lb/>almost miraculous power of
                    kindness, when accompanied, <lb/>as genuine kindness often is, with quiet
                    feeling and unob<lb break="no"/>trusive goodness, continues to be exemplified in
                    the Ladies' <lb/>Committee, of which Mrs <hi rend="smallcaps">Fry</hi>, we
                    believe, is still at the head. <lb/>In Newgate, idleness, dissipation, and
                    licentiousness, have <lb/>been succeeded by industry, order, and restraint ; and
                    the <lb/>same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships <lb/>in which
                    convicts are embarked for New South Wales. <lb/>Arrangements are thus made for
                    the formation of schools <lb/>for moral and religious instruction during the
                    voyage, and <lb/>the convicts are furnished not only with suitable clothing
                    <lb/>and other necessaries, but the means of employment in the <lb/>manufacture
                    of such articles as may be readily sold for their <lb/>relief on arriving at the
                    colony. These are truly good <lb/>works ; and too much praise cannot be bestowed
                    on the <lb/>Ladies by whom they are performed. It is gratifying to <cb/>
                    <lb/>observe that Female Associations for visiting prisons have <lb/>been
                    established in Bedford, Bristol, Carlisle, Colchester, <lb/>Derby, Dumfries,
                    Durham, Exeter, Lancaster, Notting<lb break="no"/>ham, Plymouth, York, and <hi
                        rend="italic">Glasgow</hi>. We had once thought <lb/>that, by this time, we
                    might have added <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi> ; and <lb/>we are inclined to
                    hope that the present Lord Pro<lb break="no"/>vost will yet employ his influence
                    in establishing a La<lb break="no"/>dy's Society for the prisons of our
                    Metropolis.&#x2013; <lb/>There, too, we had cherished, and still cherish, the
                    hope, <lb/>of seeing a House of Refuge. The temporary refuge of <lb/>the Prison
                    Society is chiefly for affording relief to distress<lb break="no"/>ed boys, who,
                    on their discharge from the prisons of the <lb/>metropolis, have expressed a
                    desire to abandon their crimi<lb break="no"/>nal courses. Many of these are in
                    circumstances of urgent <lb/>want ; and " the Committee can now look round wtih
                        plea<lb break="no"/>sure on many who are variously settled, and <hi
                        rend="italic">conducting them-</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">selves</hi> exemplarily. In the temporary refuge they are
                    <lb/>trained up to habits of industry, instructed in moral and <lb/>religious
                    duty, and after a time are provided with suitable <lb/>situations." There is a
                    great similarity in the histories of <lb/>the individuals admitted into this
                    asylum ; but the greater <lb/>number, obviously, consists of boys, who had been
                    almost <lb/>driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or
                    <lb/>destitution, or who, from neglect or loss of parents, had <lb/>fallen into
                    the company of professed thieves. The Commit<lb break="no"/>tee mention that on
                    one recent occasion, no less than <hi rend="italic">eight</hi>
                    <lb/>boys were released from Newgate in one day, and imme<lb break="no"/>diately
                    after they had undergone the sentence of <hi rend="italic">flogging,</hi>
                    <lb/>which, upon some insane rule, is usually carried into ef<lb break="no"
                    />fect on the day of their discharge. Their persons are thus <lb/>marked with
                    the stigma of guilt, and, from soreness and <lb/>want of strength, they are
                    disabled from working, at the <lb/>very time they ought to go in search of
                    employment. No <lb/>more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate
                    these <lb/>boys against society, to prevent them from obtaining employ<lb
                        break="no"/>ment, though desirous of it, or to impel them to recommence
                    <lb/>their career of crime. We entreat those who are inclined to <lb/>look upon
                    what they call a <hi rend="italic">smart whipping</hi> as the only corrective
                    <lb/>for juvenile offences, to reflect a little on the consequences <lb/>to
                    which their system inevitably tends. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> are decidedly,
                    <lb/>and in all cases, against the deliberate infliction of pain, <lb/>merely to
                    be felt as such. In the case of children, if not <lb/><hi rend="italic"
                        >necessary</hi> for that purpose, it will certainly give them the <lb/>idea
                    of power superior to their own, and may thus be the <lb/>means of constraining
                    more readily than otherwise ; but <lb/><hi rend="italic">the law</hi>, when it
                    inflicts pain, has always other means of <lb/>evincing its power, and
                    constraining those who are within <lb/>its grasp. Its most important function is
                    to <hi rend="italic">prevent crime ;</hi>
                    <lb/>its next is o convince those who comit offences that the <lb/>means of
                    detection are, on the whole, so sure that no<lb break="no"/>thing is to be
                    gained by the commission ; and its next, to <lb/>make restitution onerous and
                    complete. There may also <lb/>be some classes of criminals who ought to be
                    considered <lb/>and treated as <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>&#x2013;some are
                    curable ; and some as incur<lb break="no"/>ably furious, who must either be cut
                    off altogether, or <lb/>confined for life. We are not opposed to the infliction
                    <lb/>of punishments, because in our opinion the most effec<lb break="no"/>tual
                    of those will be found to consist in the best means <lb/>of preventing or
                    remedying the evils produced by crime. <lb/>All exposures, restraints,
                    constraints, and compulsory re<lb break="no"/>parations are punishments. We are
                    only hostile to the inflic<lb break="no"/>tion of pain for no other purpose but
                    because pain is produced. <lb/>If it can be made <hi rend="italic">obvious</hi>
                    to the sufferers that the pain inflicted <lb/><hi rend="italic">protects
                        others</hi>, or affords <hi rend="italic">true reparation</hi> for the

                        break="no"/>nishments may be both just and expedient. The Prison
                    <lb/>Society, while they vindicate themselves, temperately but <lb/>firmly, from
                    the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind <lb/>and irrational benevolence,
                    and advocated measures which <lb/>went to raise the condition of prisoners above
                    that of com<lb break="no"/>mon labourers, do still seem to us to have been too
                    much <lb/>moved by the coarse jokes and reckless speculations of a <lb/>clever
                    essayist. If they err at all, they seem now to be <lb/>somewhat too indulgent to
                    the advocates of hard labour <lb/>and severe punishments. We are rather inclined
                    to think <lb/>them too decidely in favour of the tread mill, which they
                    <lb/>allow has been so worked or constructed at different places <cb/>
                    <lb/>as to form very unequal measures of punishment, and they <lb/>very properly
                    insist that every tread-mill should be pro<lb break="no"/>vided with " a
                    regulator," by which its rate of revolution <lb/>may at all times be restrained
                    within safe limits, and a <lb/>dial-register, (lately invented by Mr <hi

                    ascertained, and which <lb/>( they think ) should in no case exceed 12,000 feet
                    in ascent <lb/>for one day. There is an able argument in the report against
                    <lb/>compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned <lb/><hi

                <p>In January, 1823, there were 3,031 in the hulks ; 2,138 have <lb/>been received
                    since ; 1,402 have been sent to New South Wales ; <lb/>and 300 to <hi
                        rend="italic">Bermuda</hi> ; 468 have been discharge by pardon or
                    <lb/>transferred to other establishments ; 3 have escaped ; 43 have died ;
                    <lb/>and 2,953 remained in the different hulks on 1st Janury last. <lb/>The
                    health of these prisoners has been good, their conduct or<lb break="no"
                    />derly.</p>
                <p>The Office-bearers of the <hi rend="italic">Refuge for the Destitute</hi> have,
                    during <lb/>the last year, given relief to 424 persons. They have apprenticed
                    <lb/>to trades, recommended to service or employment, or restored to pa<lb

                    at present <lb/>154. Most of the male culprits require to be kept two years at
                    <lb/>least. The expenditure has been very considerable. Mr Peel has
                    <lb/>recommended a grant from Parliament.</p>
                <p>As we feared, the bill introduced for the purpose of qualifying <lb/>persons
                    possessed of personal property to serve as juries contains <lb/>no regulations
                    for the more impartial striking of juries, or returning <lb/>or making up of

                <p>Repeated instances have lately occurred, in whcih dwelling<lb break="no"/> houses
                    have suffered damage by fire, owing to the carelessnes of <lb/>servants and
                    others, who, by way of economy, take off fires at <lb/>night and put the burning
                    coals under the grate, not recollecting <lb/>that, in the construction of almost
                    every house, the stone placed <lb/>under the grate is supported by timber,
                    separated from the hearth <lb/>stone by some lime only. The wood underneath
                    being once ig<lb break="no"/>nited, the fire will rapidly spread, and may in a
                    few hours involve <lb/>the whole tenement in flames.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to Australia.</hi>&#x2013;We understand that the
                        esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of an Australian Company has suggested to a
                        num<lb break="no"/>ber of public spirited individuals the idea of forming a
                    society to <lb/>aid deserving persons in their endeavours to emigrate and settle
                    in <lb/>New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, and that matters are
                    <lb/>actually in progress for carrying this benevolent project into effect.
                    <lb/>On Wednesday a meeting was held in the Freemasons' Hall, Niddry
                    <lb/>Street, which was respectably attended, the Rev. Mr Lothian in <lb/>the
                    Chair, when a series of resolutions were moved by William <lb/>Ellis, Esq. S. S.
                    C., and seocnd by Robert Paul, Esq. of the <lb/>Commercial Bank. The principal
                    object comprehended in those <lb/>were the security of the persons and property
                    of emigrants on the <lb/>voyage&#x2013;the maintenance of a regular
                    communication with friends <lb/>left behind, and the insuring a friendly
                    welcome, temporary ac<lb break="no"/>commodation, and facilities for permanent
                    settlement in the country <lb/>of their adoption. It was also proposed to give
                    assistance in <lb/>money to deserving emigrants, for the purpose of defraying
                    the <lb/>expenses of freight and passage out&#x2013;every applicant being first
                    <lb/>well recommended, and his character subjected to strict scrutiny.
                    <lb/>Masons, wrights, smiths, and other artisans, schoolmasters, farm<lb

                    principles of <lb/>the society specially apply.</p>
                <p>According to the opinion of persons largely engaged in the silk<lb break="no"/>
                    trade, the amount of drawback to be allowed on silk that has paid <lb/>the duty
                    will be between t300,000 and t400,000.</p>
                <p>On Sunday evening a disturbance took place in a house in <lb/>Tobago Street, and
                    the Police were called, who, to make sure of <lb/>the rioter, secured the door ;
                    at which a young woman, a servant, <lb/>became so much alarmed, that she leaped
                    out of a window, situat<lb break="no"/>ed on the third floor, whereby her back
                    was broken. She now lies <lb/>very ill in the Royal Infirmary.</p>

                <p><pb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Secretary Peel</hi>, in moving the commitment of the
                        Trans<lb break="no"/>portation Bill, stated, that the objects of the bill
                    were, first, to <lb/>continue the laws on transportation, that would expire
                    before the <lb/>next session ; and next, to cimplify the law. In the last
                    session <lb/>a bill had been passed to enable the Crown to make an experiment
                    <lb/>of the union of the hulk and transportation system, by sending
                    <lb/>convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to de<lb break="no"
                    />cide fully on the experiment, but, as far as it could be judged of, it
                    <lb/>was satisfactory. It had been hithero complained that transporta<lb
                        break="no"/>tion was a very esqual punishment, and certainly there was a
                    great <lb/>different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled ha<lb
                        break="no"/>bits, and with a family, and upon a man of no fixed habits, to
                    whom, <lb/>as hitherto managed, it had scarcely been a punishment. He wish<lb
                        break="no"/>ed it to be known, that arrangements had been made in New South
                    <lb/>Wales, to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the set<lb
                        break="no"/>tlement, where the punishment would be more severe. A selection
                    <lb/>would be made from the convicts, so as to make the punishment
                    <lb/>efficient against those to whom it had hitherto had no terror.&#x2013;
                    <lb/>He gave this statement because it was right the public should <lb/>know
                    that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment.</p>

                <p>Mr Greig, after stating the correspondence which took place be<lb break="no"
                    />tween him and the Fiscal, which led to the suppression of his jour<lb

                        func<lb break="no"/>tionary. "On Monday evening, the Fiscal sent a messenger
                    to <lb/>me, requesting I would call at his house, in Strand-street; I did
                    <lb/>so ; he then opened a conversation upon the subject of my paper, <lb/><hi
                        rend="italic">The South African Commercial Advertiser</hi>, and said he was
                        in<lb break="no"/>structed to inform me that I had departed from the
                    Prospectus &#x2013; <lb/>that it was become obnoxious to the Government, and
                    referred <lb/>more particularly to the last three or four Numbers. I asked him
                    <lb/>to point out such parts as were immediately objectionable. He then
                    <lb/>mentioned some <hi rend="italic">leading remarks</hi>, which (he said) bore
                    upon the <lb/>Administration of the Colony. He further pointed out as "<hi

                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">noxious,</hi>" all quotations which had been made from "
                    De Lolne[?], <lb/>"Blackstone," and " Civil Servant's"work " Lacon," and, ge<lb

                    observing <lb/>&#x2013;" Nobody can doubt the obvious tendency of these ; and,
                    as we <lb/>are not men in this Colony, but merely infants," it was, in his
                        opi<lb break="no"/>nion, dangerous to insert such matter. He added, also,
                    that it was <lb/>expected I should, in future, publish no parts of trials, but
                    wait <lb/>until the whole were finished ; and, even then, all scurrilous parts
                    <lb/>(such as the Memorial of Mr L. Cooke to the Treasury), were to <lb/>be
                    omitted. That I was further to bound down with two sure<lb break="no"/>ties, in
                    the penalty of ten thousand rix-dollars, that nothing of the <lb/>offensive
                    nature pointed out, should appear in any future number ; <lb/>and, lastly, that
                    I was to take particular care, that the next num<lb break="no"/>ber (18)
                    contained no matter of the description alluded to, nor any <lb/>notice of Mr
                    Edward's trial. To all this, I replied, that I would <lb/>give no promise as to
                    what would appear in the next or any future <lb/>number. That I required time to
                    consider what was fitting to be <lb/>done with regard to the security
                    demanded."</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Morning Chronicle</hi> makes the following remarks on this
                    <lb/>case :&#x2013; We cannot say that we are surprised that acts of this de<lb
                        break="no"/>scription should take place in our Colonies. Uncontrouled power
                    <lb/>produces every day in Europe the worst effects on men of the best
                    <lb/>dispositions, and the best talents, and the Governors of our con<lb
                        break="no"/>quered Colonies, and New South Wales, are unfortunately
                    <lb/>quite absolute. In Europe the people under absolute Governments <lb/>have
                    this advantage over the people in our colonies, that men in <lb/>office are
                    generally selected with some reference to abilities and ac<lb break="no"
                    />quirements. But with the exception of the East Indies, the Go<lb break="no"
                    />nernment of which, with all its faults, generally, we believe, avails
                    <lb/>itself of talents, our colonies are unfortunately considered as mere
                    <lb/>places of refuge for the relatives of our Aristocracy, of whom nothing
                    <lb/>can be made in this country. This is what constitutes fitness for a
                    <lb/>Colonial Office ; and so far from being astonished at the disgrace<lb
                        break="no"/>ful scenes which are constantly taking place in the colonies,
                    every <lb/>person capable of reflecting at all upon the matter would be asto<lb
                        break="no"/>nished were he to find common abilities the holder of a colonial
                    <lb/>appointment of any value. Of Lord Charles Somerset, the less that <lb/>is
                    said the better. In fact nothing is more wanted than the perusal <lb/>of a Cape
                    of Good Hope Almanack, to satisfy the British public <lb/>what sort of personage
                    he is. Would it be believe, that in a <lb/>country of boundless extent, with
                    only a settlement here and there, <lb/>where the greatest enemies the Colonists
                    have to contend with, are <lb/>the wild animals, it could possible enter in to
                    the head of any ra<lb break="no"/>rional being to introduce laws for the
                    preservation of game. One <lb/>would as soon expect to hear laws in Turkey for
                    the preservation <lb/>of the plague. Yet it so happens, that a code which would
                    do <lb/>credit to Sir John Shelley himself, guarding against the possible
                    <lb/>disinction of the game of Africa, occupies a goodly space in the <lb/>Cape
                    Almanack. After such a specimen of wisdom, all criticism on <lb/>this personage
                    would be thrown away.</p>

                    the little god delighted to dwell in <lb/>prisoned solitude ; true it is and of

                    since a couple, who had imbided the tender pas<lb break="no"/>sion, were linked
                    in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and <lb/>a like consumnation, most devoutly to
                    be wished for <lb/>by another pair of inmates, would ere now have taken

                </p>
                <p>The Speaker took the Chair at a few minutes before <lb/>four o'clock, and was
                    shortly afterwards summoned by <lb/>the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, to attend
                    the <lb/>House of Lords.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Speaker</hi> stated, on his return, that the Royal
                    <lb/>Assent had been given by Commission to several public <lb/>and private
                    bills.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Dundas</hi> presented a petition from Newbury, <lb/>in
                    the county of Berks, praying for the abolition of sla<lb break="no"/>very in the
                    West Indies.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Planta</hi> moved for a new writ for the election of
                    <lb/>a member to serve in Parliament, in the room of Lord <lb/>Leveson Gower,
                    who had accepted the office of Chief<lb break="no"/> Secretary for
                    Ireland.&#x2013;Ordered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Ale-House Licensing Bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Estcourt</hi>, the house resolved
                    <lb/>itself into a committee on this bill.</p>
                <p>On the clause that no brewer who should himself sup<lb break="no"/>ply public
                    houses with beer, should be allowed to act or <lb/>assist as a Magistrate at any
                    meeting or session for the <lb/>granting of licenses,</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernal</hi> moved that this clause be struck out
                    <lb/>altogether.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Gordon</hi> supported the clause.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Monck</hi> thought this the most valuable clause <lb/>in
                    the bill, and that it was no infringemnt, but a sa<lb break="no"/>lutary
                    interference with the jurisdiction of borough <lb/>magistrates.</p>
                <p>Strangers were ordered to withdraw, and the com<lb break="no"/>mittee divided,
                    when there were&#x2013;Ayes 46&#x2013;Noes 53&#x2013; <lb/>Majority against the
                    clause 7.</p>
                <p>Several amendments, verbal and otherwise, were then <lb/>agreed to, amongst which
                    was the omission of the <lb/>words " Cinque Ports," thus excluding that class of
                    <lb/>places from the operation of the bill. <cb/>
                    <lb/>On the clause being proposed relative to the hours <lb/>during which public
                    houses should be kept open on <lb/>Sundays.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Estcourt</hi> said, the original clause was to the
                    <lb/>effect that public-houses should be closed during the <lb/>hours of morning
                    and afternoon's divine service, but he <lb/>thought it would be better not to
                    permit publicans to <lb/>allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after
                    <lb/>the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service <lb/>(one o'clock.)</p>
                <p>After a conversation, in which several hon. members <lb/>participated, the clause
                    was agreed to.</p>
                <p>Several other clauses having been then read and agreed <lb/>to, the house resumed
                    ; the report was brought up, or<lb break="no"/>dered to be taken into further
                    consideration on Monday <lb/>next, and printed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">The Usury Laws.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">P. Thompson</hi> moved the second reading of the
                    <lb/>usury laws amendment bill.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Davenport</hi> said he should oppose the bill, as <lb/>he
                    considered it to be highly injurious both to the land<lb break="no"/>ed and
                    commercial interests. The hon. members moved <lb/>an amendment, that the bill be
                    read a second time that <lb/>day three months.</p>
                <p>The question on th amendment having been put,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Exchequer</hi> suggested <lb/>the propriety of postponing this bill until
                    the next ses<lb break="no"/>sion of parliament. He made this suggestion from no
                    <lb/>unfriendly feeling towards the bill, but merely because <lb/>this was not,
                    he conceived, the most convenient time to <lb/>consider it. The subject ought to
                    be fully considered, <lb/>with a view to get rid of evils that existed, without
                        in<lb break="no"/>terfering with long-continued prejudices. If the dis<lb
                        break="no"/>cussion were postponed he would give the subject the <lb/>best
                    attention in his, (<hi rend="italic">hear</hi>.)</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Heathcote</hi> approved of the suggestion of the
                    <lb/>right hon. gentleman, and wished the discussion on the <lb/>question to be
                    postponed till the next session of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"> L. Foster</hi> thought that, between the total repeal,
                    <lb/>or the continued existence of the Usury Laws, in their <lb/>present shape,
                    a middle course might be steered. Of <lb/>the bill before the house he thought
                    that, under the <lb/>guise of a simple enactment, it covered one of the great<lb
                        break="no"/>est illusion ever held forth to Parliament or the coun<lb
                        break="no"/>try, for he was convinced that it would effect as com<lb
                        break="no"/>plete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as
                    <lb/>could be proposed. It became necessary, therefore, to <lb/>consider the
                    probable operation of that repeal upon all <lb/>the great interest of the
                    country. The bill might give <lb/>relief to few, but would bring injury to
                    many.</p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> thought the house indebted to <lb/>the
                    hon. member for Dover for bringing in the bill. It <lb/>might be possible to
                    form a bill better than that of the <lb/>hon. member, but his bill was better
                    than the present <lb/>law, and as such he should vote for it.</p>
                <p>The gallery was then cleared, and the house divided, <lb/>when there appeared for
                    the second reading,&#x2013;Ayes, 52; <lb/>Noes, 40 : majority in favour of the
                    second reading, 12.</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Voters' Registration Bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Nugent</hi> moved the second reading of the
                    <lb/>voters' registration bill, and said that his object in car<lb break="no"
                    />rying it through the present stage was, that the bill <lb/>might be committed
                        <hi rend="italic">pro forma,</hi> for the purpose of hav<lb break="no"/>ing
                    certain amendment introduced into it. It would <lb/>then be printed with its
                    amendments, in order that the <lb/>house and the country might have the
                    opportunity of <lb/>considering its details between this and the next session
                    <lb/>of Parliament.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Wilson</hi> moved, as an amendment, that the
                    <lb/>bill might be read a second time that day six months.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">H. Gurney</hi> seconded the amendment.</p>
                <p>The question was then put on the amendment, which <lb/>was agreed to, and the
                    bill was ordered to be read a se<lb break="no"/>cond time this day six
                    months.</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Salmon Fisheries Preservation Bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>On the motion of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Exche-</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">quer</hi>, the house resolved itself into a committee
                    on the <lb/>salmon fisheries preservation bill.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Ferguson</hi> proposed the insertion of a clause,
                    <lb/>exempting from the operation of the bill the salmon <lb/>fisheries in the
                    River and Bay of Thurso, in the county <lb/>of Caithness, which are the
                    exclusive property of Sir <lb/>John Sinclair.</p>
                <p>After some conversation the gallery was cleared, and <lb/>the committee divided,
                    when the clause was lost.</p>
                <p>The bill having passed through the committee, the <lb/>report was ordered to be
                    received this day.</p>
                <p>The other orders were then disposed of, and the house <lb/>adjourned at half-past

                <p>A number of petitions were presented against the <lb/>continuance of Negreo

                </p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">G. Hill</hi> presented a petition from the Chamber
                    <lb/>of Commerce of the city of Londonderry, praying that <lb/>the bill for

                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">A. Chichester</hi> presented a petition from Bel<lb

                </p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord Advocate</hi>, in moving that this bill be
                    <lb/>read a second time and printed, observed, that it was <lb/>not his
                    intention to press it further during the present <lb/>Session. No man could,
                    however, deny that the <lb/>object of the Bill was of great importance, and he
                    <lb/>proposed, therefore, to have its provisions made <lb/>generally known
                    throughout the country, in order that <lb/>it might be again presented to the
                    house in as perfect a <lb/>shape as possible.</p>
                <p>The bill was then read a second time, and ordered to <lb/>be printed.</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Committee of Supply.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In the committee of supply, a number of grants of mi<lb break="no"/>nor
                    importance were agreed to.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">H. Hardinge</hi> said, he had another resolution to
                    <lb/>propose, but it was in which he expected that a re<lb break="no"/>duction
                    would be made next year. It was, that a sum <lb/>of L283,199, 8s 1d be granted
                    for the expenses of the <lb/>disembodied[?] militia of the united kingdom.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Spring Rice</hi> said, that within the last twelve
                    <lb/>years there had been two millions and a half expended <lb/>on this body,
                    and that the subject was one which few <lb/>gentlemen took the trouble to look
                    at. He begged to say <lb/>a word upon the Irish militia. There the whole of the
                    <lb/>staff, which was larger than that of England, was with<lb break="no"/>out a
                    private man. Nothing could a more outra<lb break="no"/>geous job than that of
                    the milita in Ireland. The co<lb break="no"/>lonels kept the whole patronage of
                    the regiment, and <lb/>kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and
                    <lb/>friends. The militia might have been of service at one <lb/>time in Ireland
                    ; but since that time the present effec<lb break="no"/>tive police had been
                    established, and quite superseded <lb/>it. He trusted Ministers would not suffer
                    this to remain <lb/>if they really wished to be economical, and curtail, if
                    <lb/>not abolish it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Exchequer</hi> begged to <lb/>assure his hon. friend that he wanted no
                    prompting to <lb/>make any economical reduction. When, however, a <lb/>plan for
                    the reduction of the staff was ready, and it was <lb/>in contemplation, it would
                    be laid before Parliament, <lb/>and he should then be the friend of the definite
                    and li<lb break="no"/>mited powers to which he had alluded.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hume</hi> said, the militia had been defended as
                    <lb/>though the country were in hourly danger of invasion <cb/>
                    <lb/>&#x2013;as if the country could be taken by surprise. If that <lb/>were so,
                    he would gladly learn of what use were the <lb/>spies, who cost us L450,000
                    a-year. We had ambas<lb break="no"/>sadors&#x2013;they were very little better
                    than spies&#x2013;at an <lb/>expense of L450,00a-year ; and if their cautious
                        ob<lb break="no"/>servance were not sufficient to save the country from
                    <lb/>sudden invasion, he knew no better means, and he cer<lb break="no"/>tainly
                    knew no other advantage which ambassadors and <lb/>consuls could be of.</p>

                <p>On the order of the day having been read for the <lb/>house resolving itself into

                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi> moved that the Speaker do leave <lb/>the

                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">J. Mackintosh</hi> said, the object of his present

                    instruction to the committee on the bill <lb/>which the right hon. gentleman (Mr
                    Huskisson) had <lb/>introduced&#x2013;first, to the effect that the committee
                    should <lb/>recommend the introduction of a clause for the esta<lb break="no"
                    />blishment of a trial by jury in New South Wales and <lb/>Van Diemen's Land;
                    and secondly, that it should re<lb break="no"/>commend that a clause be
                    introduced, providing for the <lb/>election of one-third of the Legislative
                    Council from <lb/>among persons enjoying an income of L100 a year, and
                    <lb/>having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space[?] <lb/>of three
                    years. The best local authories in fa<lb break="no"/>vour of his proposition.
                    Among these he might men<lb break="no"/>tion the names of Governor Hunter,
                    Governor Bligh, <lb/>Mr Bent, the Judge Advocate, Governor Macquarrie, <lb/>and
                    his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane, who had gone <lb/>out to the colony
                    prejudiced against the introduction in<lb break="no"/>to it of these
                    institutions ; but, after two years careful <lb/>investigation of the subject,
                    wrote home in Oct. 1825, <lb/>stating, that there was now no longer any doubt
                    <lb/>about its perfect ripeness for them.&#x2013;(<hi rend="italic">Hear,
                        hear.)&#x2013;</hi>
                    <lb/>The partial introduction of English institutions into <lb/>immediate
                    practise was the only pledge of a real inten<lb break="no"/>tion on the part of
                    government to introduce them more <lb/>completely in the end. The right hon.
                    gent. concluded <lb/>by moving that instruction be given to the committee
                    <lb/>to recommend the introduction of Trial by Jury into the <lb/>colony, and to
                    allow the inhabitants a voice in the le<lb break="no"/>gislative councils.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi> said, in the bill which he had intro<lb
                        break="no"/>duced, it was intended to extend the privilege to the
                    <lb/>government of the country of granting trial by jury <lb/>in all civil
                    cases. His right hon. friend would find, if <lb/>he examined, that the
                    foundation would be laid of grant<lb break="no"/>ing the inhabitants of that
                    colony a share in managing <lb/>their own concerns. At present the legislature
                        propos<lb break="no"/>ed, by way of a first step, to appoint a legislative
                        com<lb break="no"/>mittee for the purpose of watching and controuling
                    <lb/>every measure of the state. All trials should be public, <lb/>under the
                    inspection of a free press, and a population <lb/>jealous of their rights. They
                    should now be prepared <lb/>in the course of a few years for the regular
                        introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of a legislative assembly ; not had he any
                    fears <lb/>when such a change should take place, that it would <lb/>lead to any
                    political convulsion.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hume</hi> had every reason to believe, that if, in<lb
                        break="no"/>stead of inflicting a military governemtn, they would
                    <lb/>introduce a portion of representation and the privileges <lb/>of British
                    subjects into New South Wales, it would be <lb/>the most flourishing of the
                    colonies.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Horace Twiss</hi> said, the knowledge of one fact
                    <lb/>might obviate the necessity for one at least of the <lb/>right hon. gent.'s
                    propsitions, namely, that the gover<lb break="no"/>nor of the colony had the
                    power of extending to the co<lb break="no"/>lonists the right of trial by jury
                    if he should deem it ex<lb break="no"/>pedient.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">James Mackintosh</hi> here intimated that he <lb/>should
                    not press his amendments. They were accord<lb break="no"/>ingly negatived.</p>
                <p>The house then resolved itself into the Committee <lb/>when several verbal
                    amendments were proposed and <lb/>agreed to.</p>
                <p>The bill then went through the committee, and the <lb/>report, with the
                    amendments, was ordered to be brought <lb/>up on Monday.</p>
                <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, <lb/>and the house adjourned
                    at half-past two o'clock.</p>

                <p>Sir J. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mackintosh</hi> presented a petition from Mr
                    <lb/>Charles Buck, complaining that managers of theatres <lb/>were allowed to
                    perform dramatic pieces without the <lb/>knowledge or leave of the writer, and
                    without any pro<lb break="no"/>fit to him. The hon. member said that Lord Byron
                    <lb/>and Mr Millman had made similar complaints, and that <lb/>every person who
                    had given that subject consideration <lb/>admitted that literary property was

                        break="no"/>fitable nature of that description of writing, as compar<lb
                        break="no"/>ed with other branches of literature ; and it would be <lb/>very
                    desirable if a dramatic author had power to sell his <lb/>play like any other
                    description of property, and that no <lb/>manager should perform it without
                    paying the writer, <lb/>which was the system in France.</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Birmingham Petition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Brougham</hi> rose to present a petition from a very
                    <lb/>respectable body. It had been agreed to at a numerous <lb/>meeting of
                    manufacturers, artisans, and other inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of Birmingham,
                    and was signed by 8000 persons <lb/>without solicitation. they contended that
                    the distress <lb/>which now prevailed, not only had reference to that
                    <lb/>poorer classes of society, but spread itself over the whole <lb/>system of
                    society. This distress the petitioners ascrib<lb break="no"/>ed to the tampering
                    that had taken place with the cur<lb break="no"/>rency. Their opinion was, that
                    too much stress was laid <lb/>upon the panic which had taken place in 1825 ;
                    for, <lb/>though it was true that a great number of failures had <lb/>taken
                    place among the bankers, yet it was no less true, <lb/>that of about 70 bankers
                    who had failed, as many as <lb/>80[?] had subsequently paid 20s in the pound. If
                    such <lb/>were the case he was very glad to hear it. The opinion <lb/>of the
                    petitioners rather was, that the present distress <lb/>arose from the
                    speculations and over-trading which had <lb/>taken place ; and that such might
                    have been the case <lb/>topitally[?], there could be no manner of doubt, That a
                    <lb/>great deal of the distress of the nation had arisen from <lb/>the
                    depreciation of the currency, by which people were <lb/>now paying taxes at a
                    rate that had never been intend<lb break="no"/>ed when they were originally
                    imposed, was extremely <lb/>likely ; but whether it operated to the extent that
                    the <lb/>petitioners described was another question. In the year <lb/>1819 he
                    had been one of those who had resisted the im<lb break="no"/>position of new
                    taxes, because he thought that that was <lb/>the very worst time that Ministers
                    could have chosen <lb/>for such an object. His opinion, however, had been
                    <lb/>over-ruled, and the taxes had been increased. That <lb/>the effect of this
                    must be to cripple the industry of the <lb/>country no man could doubt ; and
                    what he wished was <lb/>to see a remedy for t ; but the misfortune was, that
                    <lb/>after making every possible retrenchment&#x2013;by reducing <lb/>salaries,
                    and dealing in the best possible way with all <lb/>the payments which the nation
                    had to make&#x2013;the Dead <lb/>Weight would still remain round the neck of the
                        coun<lb break="no"/>try, and press it down to the effectual injury of its
                    best <lb/>interests. How were they to get over the 800 millions <lb/>of debt,
                    and the 30 or 40 millions of interest annually <lb/>payable thereon? In the
                    latter part of the petition he <lb/>entirely agreed, and hoped that every thing
                    would be <cb/>
                    <lb/>done to give the people as great relief from the pressure <lb/>of the taxes
                    as might be consistent with a due regard to <lb/>the public credit, and the
                    service of the State ; and so <lb/>far from treating this remedy lightly, the
                    more he <lb/>thought that the petitioners were wrong in their obser<lb
                        break="no"/>vations on the tampering of the currency, the more he <lb/>was
                    inclined to listen to that part of the petition which <lb/>appeared to him to be
                    founded on truth.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bennett</hi> was of opinion that the forced resto<lb
                        break="no"/>ration of a metallic currency was one of the principal
                    <lb/>causes of the present distress. The taxes were now <lb/>paid in money, and
                    it now required twice the produce <lb/>to pay them which it did before the year
                    1819. That <lb/>was nothing less than a robbery, but how it was to be
                    <lb/>remedied he really was at a loss to know. He would <lb/>never break faith
                    with the public creditor, and the only <lb/>means to pay off our public debt
                    would be to impose an <lb/>income tax. If the public debt were once removed,
                    <lb/>then free trade could take place in every branch of <lb/>trade, but not
                    till then. Such was the opinion of his <lb/>late friend, Mr Ricardo, and sooner
                    or later he thought <lb/>some such measure would be resorted to.</p>
                <p>Mr Alderman <hi rend="smallcaps">Waitham</hi> observed that it was <lb/>strange
                    that while the public distress was admitted to <lb/>be extreme, no effort was
                    made to reduce the public ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. He was ready to prove
                    that the export trade <lb/>of the country had fallen off to the amount of from
                    <lb/>nearly nine to thirteen millions, although he knew that <lb/>in saying this
                    he was encountering serious adversaries. <lb/>He did not under-rate our export
                    trade ; it was valuable <lb/>but for a period of thirty-one years it had fallen
                    off at <lb/>the rate of six millions per annum ; and this could be <lb/>shewn
                    from Parliamentary documents. With respect <lb/>to the petition now before the
                    house, he mainly agreed <lb/>with its statements, while at the same time he
                    could <lb/>never consent to any thing like a breach of faith with <lb/>the
                    public creditor.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">W. Whitmore</hi> heard with astonishment that <lb/>our
                    foreign trade had greatly diminished, the reverse <lb/>being so notoriously the
                    fact. Since 1814 there was <lb/>certainly a fall in the value of our
                    manufactures, but so <lb/>there was in the raw material, and the vast increase
                    of <lb/>machinery should also be taken into account. It was <lb/>said that our
                    exports had declined, but facts would <lb/>prove decidedly the reverse. From
                    1790 to 1799, the <lb/>exports were L17,000,000 ; from 1800 to 1809,
                    <lb/>L,26,000,000; from 1810 to 1819, L36,000,000 ; from <lb/>1821 to 1826,
                    L45,000,000 ; in 1827, L51,000,000 ; and <lb/>in 1828 the amounts of exports
                    rose to L52,000,000&#x2013; <lb/>So much for the alleged decrease of our export
                    trade, as <lb/>stated by the worthy Alderman, (<hi rend="italic">hear, hear,
                        hear.</hi>) <lb/>In 1819[?] the currency was in the greatest state of
                        depre<lb break="no"/>ciation ; but he begged pardon for having said so much,
                    <lb/>and he was induced to offer a word in order to counter<lb break="no"/>act
                    the danger which might arise if the statements of <lb/>the worthy Alderman
                    remained unanswered.</p>
                <p>Mr Sec. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi> observed, that, whenever any change,
                    <lb/>however calculated to be ultimately beneficial, was made <lb/>in the system
                    of our currency, it must be attended in <lb/>the first instance with
                    considerable inconveniences. <lb/>The more he considered the subject, the more
                    was he <lb/>convinced that the best interests of the nation required <lb/>that
                    we should strictly adhere to the law of our cur<lb break="no"/>rency now
                    established. (<hi rend="italic">Hear, hear.</hi>) He hoped he <lb/>should never
                    see the time when the restrictions on cash <lb/>payments should be renewed.
                    When, however, the <lb/>petitioners declared it to be expedient to increase the
                    <lb/>amount of our currency by an issue of paper, he would <lb/>ask them what
                    they would, in that case, do with the <lb/>Exchanges? If the Exchanges fell, the
                    gold would <lb/>go out of the country. What would they do? They <lb/>must renew
                    the restriction on cash payments by the <lb/>Bank. It was not any change in the
                    value of the cur<lb break="no"/>rency, but the prosperity of Manchester that had
                        occa<lb break="no"/>sioned the depression in Spitalfields. In 1820, the
                    <lb/>number of factories in Manchester were fifty-four, and <lb/>they were
                    assessed at the annual value of L16,816 ; in <lb/>1823 they were 56, assessed at
                    L18,293 ; in 1826, when <lb/>the small notes bill passed, the numbers were 72,
                        asses<lb break="no"/>sed at L24,034 ; in 1828, the year before the small
                    <lb/>notes bill took effect, the numbers were 73, and they <lb/>were assessed at
                    L25,245. The hon. gentleman oppo<lb break="no"/>site had said that no fresh
                    capital had been employed <lb/>in this trade, but that persons would work at a
                    loss ra<lb break="no"/>ther than let their machines stand idle. But if this
                    <lb/>were the case, it would not account for the erection of <lb/>12 new
                    factories, the establishment of which was irre<lb break="no"/>concileable with
                    the idea of general stagnation. With <lb/>respect to the silk trade in
                    Manchester, in 1823 there <lb/>were 2500 looms, and in 1828 there were 8000 ;
                    and <lb/>there were between 3 and 4000 looms working ma<lb break="no"
                    />nufactured articles of silk mixed with cotton. He had <lb/>had a letter from
                    Manchester, dated 1st of June, upon <lb/>which he could rely, and it stated that
                    all the silk weav<lb break="no"/>ers were, or might be, in active emply. For the
                    last <lb/>ten years at Manchester, machinery had improved in <lb/>powers of
                    production in the ratio of 10 per cent, per an<lb break="no"/>num. Few persons
                    had attributed enough to the im<lb break="no"/>portation of labourers from
                    Ireland. A greater number <lb/>of Irish labourers in the manufacturing districts
                    were <lb/>out of emply than people could imagine, and the Ma<lb break="no"
                    />gistrates relieved them rather than pass them to their <lb/>parishes,
                    reflecting that as they had contributed to the <lb/>prosperity ot the places,
                    they had a right to relief when <lb/>in distress. Where the passage was so low,
                    and this <lb/>country possessed the advantage of a legal provision <lb/>for the
                    poor, it was impossible to check the influx of <lb/>Irish labourers, and this
                    fact would suggest important <lb/>alterations in the state of the law. (<hi
                        rend="italic">Hear, hear.</hi>) He <lb/>felt convinced that any alterations
                    with respect to the <lb/>values of the currency would be attended with the
                        great<lb break="no"/>est evils to every class.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps"> W. Horton</hi> observed, that some honourable
                    <lb/>gentleman considered the distress of our artisans and <lb/>manufacturers to
                    arise from the state of the currency ; <lb/>but he (Mr Horton) was at a loss to
                    see how the redun<lb break="no"/>dant labour at Shipley could have been affected
                    by the <lb/>change of the currency. Another class were the anti<lb break="no"
                    />podes of these&#x2013;they imputed our distress to the corn <lb/>laws. But it
                    was idle to talk of altering the corn laws; <lb/>we should look to practical
                    remedies. As long as a re<lb break="no"/>dundancy of labour existed in England,
                    which was ag<lb break="no"/>gravated by the condition of the Irish, who flocked
                    to <lb/>England, and operated a still further prejudice to the <lb/>labouring
                    class of this country, the distress would con<lb break="no"/>tinue. The remedy
                    which he proposed for the evil he <lb/>had pointed out was emigration, in the
                    manner propos<lb break="no"/>ed in the report of a committee of which he had the
                        ho<lb break="no"/>nour to be the chairman, by parishes advancing a sum
                    <lb/>of money to locate pauper labourers in our North Ame<lb break="no"/>rican
                    colonies. The right hon. gentleman then read <lb/>opinions in approbation of his
                    plan, from Mr Tooke, <lb/>Mr Malthus, Colonel Torrens, and others, and observ<lb
                        break="no"/>ed that he had the opinion of the late Mr Ricardo to <lb/>the
                    same effect, in a lette which had been published. <lb/>He then entered into a
                    calculation, to show the saving <lb/>to parishes by this plan, and he challenged
                    any member <lb/>of the house the show the fallacy of the calculations.&#x2013;
                    <lb/>There was, however, an answer so easy, that it was con<lb break="no"
                    />stantly made&#x2013;" The vacuum would be filled up im<lb break="no"
                    />mediately." This was a delicate subject to touch <lb/>upon, for he knew not
                    how the vacuum could be fill<lb break="no"/>ed up but by the introduction of
                    young gentlemen <lb/>and ladies. (<hi rend="italic">A laugh</hi>.) But was it
                    supposed that <lb/>fifty labourers would be replaced immediately by fifty
                    <lb/>children? Or did these objectors suppose that labour<lb break="no"/>ers
                    would be brought from Russia or elsewhere ? The <lb/>right honourable gentleman
                    then adverted to the re<lb break="no"/>marks in Mr Sadler's work, wherein it was
                    stated that <lb/>is appeared from the official documents that the mor<lb
                        break="no"/><cb/>
                    <lb/>tality amongst the emigrants to North America had <lb/>been in the
                    unprecedented proportion of 4 in 14, where<lb break="no"/>as, in Wales, the
                    proportion was 1 in 69, and in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, 1 in 57. This, he would
                    assert, was an incorrect <lb/>statement. So far from the proportion being 1 in
                    14, <lb/>it was only 1 in 40, the same proportion which existed <lb/>in
                    Carlisle, the healthiest place in England. The emi<lb break="no"/>grants, it
                    should be recollected, carried out children, <lb/>and the mortality amongst
                    children was in the propor<lb break="no"/>tion of 1 in 12, and in London much
                    greater ; for it had <lb/>been ascertained that out of 1,000 infants amongst the
                    <lb/>poor, only 542 survived the period of nursing. The <lb/>right hon.
                    gentleman concluded with reading his last <lb/>resolution&#x2013;" That it is
                    expedient that such measures <lb/>should be adopted in the next Session of
                    Parliament as <lb/>may furnish the most safe and effectual means of pro<lb
                        break="no"/>ducing the desird improvement, by a judicious appli<lb
                        break="no"/>cation of both these principles, and at the same time <lb/>under
                    conditions which will prevent the probability of <lb/>a recurrence of similar
                    evils, and also effect a material <lb/>saving of the national income, instead of
                    producing an <lb/>increased charge thereon."</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi> contended that colonization ought <lb/>to
                    be encouraged. Had it not been for emigration, <lb/>this country could never
                    have reached its present state <lb/>of importance and prosperity, nor would our
                    language <lb/>have been extended to the United States, and been <lb/>adopted in
                    more distant countries. If there were one <lb/>circumstance more striking than
                    another, it was the pro<lb break="no"/>digious increase of consumption, a proof
                    of the growing <lb/>wealth and resources of the country. In the year 1814,
                    <lb/>the exchange in trade was against us ; now it was in <lb/>our favour. This
                    country would carry on its great affairs <lb/>with as small a portion of
                    metallic currency as possi<lb break="no"/>ble, but let them guard against a
                    system which had led <lb/>to depreciation of the currency, and the panic which
                    <lb/>was felt in 1825. He had heard somewhere a meta<lb break="no"/>phor
                    respecting paper currency. Like a skyrocket, it <lb/>rose with splendour, but
                    lost its brightness, and when <lb/>its fire was extinguished it fell in
                    darkness, like the <lb/>shaft of the rocket, upon the heads of those who had
                    <lb/>raised it.</p>
                <p>Mr Secretary <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi> said, in consequence of the
                    <lb/>course of policy which he had deemed it advisable to <lb/>adopt in the
                    previous Session, a series of unfounded ca<lb break="no"/>lumnies had been
                    levelled at him, which, however, he <lb/>had despised too much to condescend to
                    notice. But <lb/>there was one which, as it reflected on his public and
                    <lb/>official character, he would, with permission of the <lb/>house, allude to
                    on that occasion. The report to which <lb/>he alluded was, that he had used his
                    influence as Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State to procure an enormous grant of
                    land <lb/>for a relative of his. (<hi rend="italic">Hear, hear, hear.</hi>) In
                        conse<lb break="no"/>quence of seeing this report in the public newspapers,
                    <lb/>he had requested his right honourable friend to move <lb/>in that house,
                    for the production of certain papers cal<lb break="no"/>culted to explain the
                    whole matter. Those papers <lb/>had in consequence been produced, and were now
                    <lb/>printed ; he trusted, however, that the house would <lb/>excuse him for
                    again alluding to the subject. (<hi rend="italic">Hear,</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">hear, hear.</hi>) He hoped that the consequence of those
                    <lb/>papers being printed would have been, that some mem<lb break="no"/>ber
                    would have asked some questions on the subject ; <lb/>but though this was not
                    the case, he had received a <lb/>communication which made him think that some
                    one <lb/>out of doors had been imposed upon by the calumny, <lb/>though no
                    member of that house had been so deceived, <lb/>(<hi rend="italic"
                    >cheering</hi>.) He begged in the first place, to state <lb/>most distinctly
                    that he had procured no grant of land <lb/>for any brother of his, (<hi
                        rend="italic">hear</hi>) A gentleman, whose <lb/>name was the same as his,
                    and who was his second <lb/>cousin, had had a grant made him by his right hon.
                    <lb/>friend ; but in that grant he begged to state to the <lb/>house, upon his
                    word of honour, as a gentleman, he had <lb/>had no participation whatever, (<hi
                        rend="italic">hear</hi>.) With respect <lb/>to the settlement on the Swan
                    River, he was ashamed <lb/>to say that he had neither heard nor knew of it, till
                    he <lb/>received a letter from his cousin, announcing to him <lb/>that he had
                    abandoned the idea of going to New South <lb/>Wales ; and that from the
                    circumstances of Mr Twiss in<lb break="no"/>forming him that government would be
                    disposed to afford <lb/>assistance to any settlers going to the Swan River, he
                    <lb/>and three other gentlemen had been induced to send in <lb/>a proposal to
                    that effect. With respect to the other <lb/>calumnies which had been promulgated
                    against him, <lb/>they rather went to private matters, and he had there<lb
                        break="no"/>fore not condescended to notice them ; but as this one <lb/>had
                    reference to the public department in which he of<lb break="no"/>ficiated, he
                    had thought it so far a public concern, as <lb/>to venture to ask the attention
                    of the house while he tres<lb break="no"/>passed on it to disclaim any
                    participation in the grant <lb/>that had been made, (<hi rend="italic"
                        >hear.</hi>)</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">Geo. Murray</hi>&#x2013;The house would probably
                    <lb/>think, after the statement of his right honourable friend, <lb/>that it
                    would be unnecessary for him to rise to address <lb/>them, (<hi rend="italic"
                        >hear</hi>.) He was satisfied that the house knew <lb/>that his right hon.
                    friend was incapable of proposing <lb/>anything that would come under the
                    designation of <lb/>what was vulgarly called a job, (<hi rend="italic"
                    >hear</hi>.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Adjournment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr Secretary <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi> gave notice that he should to<lb
                        break="no"/>morrow move the adjournment of the house to that day <lb/>week.
                    The right hon. gentleman at the same time <lb/>presented a petition from the
                    Apothecaries Company <lb/>of London, in favour, as we understood, of the bill
                        re<lb break="no"/>garding dissection.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Wilmot Horton</hi> rose to propose the resolu<lb
                        break="no"/>tions of wich he had given notic relative to the state <lb/>of
                    the labouring poor.</p>
                <p>The firt resolution having been put from the chair,</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancellor</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Exchequer</hi> moved as <lb/>an amendment that the order of the day be now
                    read.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Bennett</hi> opposed the resolutions.</p>
                <p>The amendement was agreed to without a division.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Labouchere</hi> postponed until to-morrow his <lb/>motion
                    respecting Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Slave Trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Otway Cave</hi> moved the following resolutions:</p>
                <p>"Resolved, 1st. That no human legislature has any <lb/>lawful power to abridge or
                    destroy the natural rights <lb/>of life and liberty, unless the owner shall
                    himself com<lb break="no"/>mit some criminal act that amounts to a
                    forfeiture.</p>
                <p>"2d, That although neither the government nor the <lb/>legislature of the county
                    have arrogated to them<lb break="no"/>selves the power of destroying the natural
                    rights <lb/>of innocent British subjects, or of delegating any <lb/>such power
                    to other authorities, it is a notorious <lb/>fact, that in many British Colonies
                    lying remote <lb/>from the immediate observation of the Government,
                    <lb/>innocent British born subjects are, from the time of <lb/>their birth,
                    robbed of their natural rights, and converted <lb/>into slaves.</p>
                <p>"3. That it is the especial duty of this House, as the <lb/>Representatives of
                    the people, to take effectual measures <lb/>for protecting all British subjects
                    that shall be born <lb/>henceforward in the West Indian Colonies, from simi<lb
                        break="no"/>lar violations of their natural, inherent, and paramount
                    <lb/>rights as human beings."</p>
                <p>The motion being seconded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Lumley,</hi></p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">W. Smith</hi> said, he could not give his support to
                    <lb/>these resolutions, because they were connected with a <lb/>question of too
                    much importance to be agitated in such <lb/>a manner, and at such a period of
                    the Session.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Huskisson</hi> was of opinion that resolutions of
                    <lb/>such a description as those brought forward by the hon. <lb/>member, ought
                    to be met by a direct negative.</p>
                <p>Strangers were then ordered to withdraw. The reso<lb break="no"/>lutions were
                    declared to be negatived without a division.</p>
                <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and <lb/>the house adjourned
                    at half-past one o'clock.</p>

                    From the same <lb/>quarter we have received a confirmation of what we

                    <lb/>is founded upon one of the fictions of an early Italian <lb/>novelist
                    (Lasca), the incidents of which almost include <lb/>the romatic and eventful
                    interest of the Arabian Nights' <lb/>Entertainments. Peake is the accredited

                <p>It is stated in a recent French paper, that during the <lb/>last eight months not
                    fewer than twenty political and <lb/>literary journals have been started in the

                <p>It is stated in a French newspaper than an inhabitant <lb/>of Lyon grafted upon
                    the same stem red and white <lb/>grapes, and peaches, and apricots, which all
                    flowered at <lb/>the same time, and gave ripe fruit with a few days of <lb/>each

                <p>A carriage, containing 60 persons, was this day seen <lb/>to traverse Paris. It
                    was drawn by six horses, merely <lb/>by way of trial. This carriage and several
                        simi<lb break="no"/>lat ones are building in the square of St Salpier. They
                    <lb/>are to run between Paris and Lyons.&#x2013;<hi rend="italic">Paris

                <p><hi rend="italic">Steam Navigation.</hi>&#x2013;Information has reached the

                    Suez, where she may be expected to <lb/>arrive early in December. Another

                    <lb/>A communication by steam between this country and <lb/>the Mediterrarean
                    has already been opened, and might, <lb/>we suppose, be easily extended to
                    Egpyt. The expense <lb/>of such a speculation would probably be amply com<lb

                    passengers on board, the whole of <lb/>whom are highly respectable, and many of
                    them are in <lb/>opulent circumstances. When Mr Peel came alongside

                    <lb/>Gurney's steam carriage was exhibited, at the request <lb/>of the Duke of
                    Wellington, in the Houslow Barrack <lb/>yard, before his Grave, the Ladies
                    Percy, Dance, and <lb/>Murray ; Lords Fitzroy Somerset, Rosslyn, and Tho<lb
                        break="no"/>mas Cecil ; Lieut. General Sir W. Gordon, Quarter<lb break="no"
                    />Master General ; Sir George Murray, Sir Charles Dance, <lb/>and a large number
                    of military and scientific gentlemen. <lb/>His Grace, Sir W. Gordon, the Ladies
                    Percy, &amp;c. had <lb/>a carriage attacked, and rode round the yard with the
                    <lb/>greatest pleasure and satisfaction. Afterwards a wag<lb break="no"/>gon was
                    fastened to the steam carriage containing 27 <lb/>soldiers besides Mr Gurney and
                    two or three men on <lb/>the engine, and though the road was very disadvanta<lb
                        break="no"/>geous, being a rough loose sand and gravel, it drew <lb/>them
                    round without the least diminuition of its speed, <lb/>between nine and ten
                    miles an hour. In these experi<lb break="no"/>ments Mr Gurney applied his steam
                    generally but to <lb/>one wheel in order to give the company full proof of
                    <lb/>the power and practicability of the invention. Having <lb/>satisfied them
                    as to this, and as to its manageability, <lb/>by a variety of involutions and
                    evolutions, he gave them <lb/>a specimen of its speed, and drove seven or eight
                    times <lb/>round at the rate of 16 or 17 miles an hour. It is <lb/>difficult to
                    say whether the company was more pleased <lb/>or surprised at these unequivocal
                    proofs of Mr Gurney's <lb/>success. The Duke of Wellington observed that it
                    <lb/>was scarcely possible to calculate the benefits we should <lb/>derive from
                    the introduction of such an invention as <lb/>this.</p>
                <p>The French papers of Tuesday state that the Em<lb break="no"/>peror Nicholas was
                    preparing to make a new levy at the <lb/>rate of 4 upon every 500 male
                    individuals, which would <lb/>give about 160,000 fresh soldiers. He is said,
                    however, to <lb/>have deferred promulgating the ukase until he should <lb/>have
                    ascertained that the Porte had definitely rejected <lb/>the terms of peace which
                    he had proposed. On the <lb/>other hand, we are told that the Sultan has
                    rejected those <lb/>terms, and that, notwithstanding the successes gained
                    <lb/>by the Russians, he was resolved to run all the chances <lb/>of a desperate
                    struggle rather than submit to conditions <lb/>which he deemed insulting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The English Bench.</hi>&#x2013;There are two vacancies at
                    <lb/>present on the judicial Bench ;&#x2013;one occasioned by the <lb/>death of
                    Mr Baron Hullock ; the other by the more <lb/>recent decease of Mr Charles
                    Warren, Chief Justice of <lb/>Chester, who expired at his house in Bedford
                    Square, <lb/>on Wednesday afternoon, in the 66th year of his age. <lb/>Mr
                    Campbell is spoken of as the successor of the for<lb break="no"/>mer ; and the
                    choise, we supposem will be generally <lb/>deemed to be a proper one. With
                    respect to the Chief <lb/>Justiceship of Chester, an evening paer, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Sun</hi>, very <lb/>properly recalls to public recollection
                    the fact, that "the <lb/>Commissioners on the Common Law had recommended <lb/>in
                    their report, the abolition of the Welsh judgeships <lb/>altogether;" and adds
                    an opinion, in which we per<lb break="no"/>fectly coincide, tht " the present
                    seems a fair op<lb break="no"/>portunity for carrying the recommendation into
                    effect." <lb/>Indeed, in our mind, every opportunity is a fair one <lb/>for
                    reducing public expences, when public burdens are <lb/>oppressive.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Platina Coin.</hi>&#x2013;We have seen a specimen of the

                    but heavier than a sovereign, and of <lb/>three roubles value. On one side are
                    the Russian eagle <lb/>and imperial arms; on the other the value of the coin,

                    <lb/>handsome woman, yet none have exceleed these writers <lb/>in descriptions
                    of female beauty. The truth is, that <lb/>the contemplation of a bottle or
                    peaked nose, a wide <lb/>mouth, goggle eyes, and a spare body, causes an author
                    <lb/>to set out with more enthusiasm in search of the ideal <lb/>of womanly
                    perfections, and affords the widest scope to <lb/>the imagination. Nothing
                    impedes the fancy more <lb/>domestic intercourse with a celestial shape and
                        di<lb break="no"/>vine face ; in which case a fatal uxoriousness supersedes
                    <lb/>the poet's diligence, and he ceases impotently to de<lb break="no"/>scribe
                    what he can well enjoy. Milton's Eve was not <lb/>copied from Mrs Milton

                </p>
                <p>It will be seen from our private letter, that unfavou<lb break="no"/>rable
                    accounts respecting his Majesty's health were cir<lb break="no"/>culating in
                    London at 7 o'clock on Wednesday even<lb break="no"/>ing. In our last we alluded
                    to the suspicions which <lb/>the non-appearance of bulletins for four days after
                    the <lb/>first, gave rise to. On Monday a second bulletin ap<lb break="no"
                    />peared, certainly not of a character to remove the pub<lb break="no"/>lic
                    anxiety, and this has been followed by two days' <lb/>silence. Every one
                    naturally puts the question, "If <lb/>his Majesty is better, why not state this
                    in a bulletin, <lb/>that the thousand discouraging rumours in circulation
                    <lb/>may be put to rest?" The <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>
                    <lb/>says, that the high officers of State are not much <lb/>better informed on
                    the subject than others, and that <lb/>a knowledge of his Majesty's real
                    condition is <lb/>confined to the very few immediately around his <lb/>person.
                    In the absence of correct information, infe<lb break="no"/>rences are drawn from
                    every passing circumstance. It <lb/>was observed that Sir Henry Halford very
                    shortly after <lb/>his return from Windsor on Tuesday morning had a <lb/>long
                    interview with the Duke of Wellington ; and it <lb/>has not escaped notice, that
                    his Majesty's sister, the <lb/>Duchess of Gloucester, had been sent for to visit
                    him. <lb/>The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> says, that according to reports which
                    are <lb/>circulated in high quarters, his Majesty's illness ex<lb break="no"
                    />cites considerable alarm, and that gout in the <lb/>stomach is complicated
                    with dropsical symptoms. <lb/>What credit may be due to these statements, we
                    <lb/>cannot tell; but whether they be true or false, <lb/>they furnish a reason
                    for the publication of offi<lb break="no"/>cial intelligence. The King's health
                    is a matter <lb/>which concerns the public deeply, and all mystery and
                    <lb/>deception on the subject are most reprehensible. We <lb/>refer to our
                    London head for a variety of articles upon <lb/>the subject ; and if this
                    night's mail bring any addi<lb break="no"/>tional information of importance we
                    shall publish it <lb/>in a secoond edition.</p>
                <p>The two Houses of Parliament meet again on <lb/>Monday.</p>
                <p>We publish the address of the Birmingham Union <lb/>to day, and meant to
                    accompany it with some remarks, <lb/>but have only time at present to express
                    out regret <lb/>that so masterly a paper, dealing in great and immu<lb
                        break="no"/>table principles, should have its value lessened by <lb/>being
                    so much mixed up with ephemeral matters, and <lb/>with false or questionable
                    doctrines respecting cur<lb break="no"/>rency.</p>
                <p>The passion for emigrating to Swan River has not <lb/>received any check. There
                    are four ships now at Lon<lb break="no"/>don, and as many more at other ports,
                    which are pre<lb break="no"/>paring to sail for the settlement with passengers.
                        In<lb break="no"/>deed the numbers who are flying from the country at
                    <lb/>this moment who are, we believe, quite unprecedented. <lb/>Within the last
                    ten days we have seen notices of fifteen <lb/>ships that were loading with
                    emigrants at Hull, twelve <lb/>at Waterford, and several at Bristol, Liverpool,
                    and <cb/>
                    <lb/>Greenock, all destined, we think, for the United States, <lb/>or British
                    America. The exportation of human beings <lb/>from the British Isles, to
                    different quarters of the <lb/>world, must now be proceeding at the rate of one
                    or <lb/>two thousand per week.</p>
                <p>It will be remembered, that according to reports <lb/>from India received some
                    time ago, Lord William <lb/>Bentick had issued an order, abolishing those horrid
                    <lb/>human sacrifices, the <hi rend="italic">Suttees</hi>. Doubts were thrown
                    <lb/>upon this intelligence when the subject was lately <lb/>talked of in
                    Parliament ; but we are happy to say, that <lb/>its accuracy is confirmed by the
                    arrival of the official <lb/>document. It is disgraceful to the British Indian
                        Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, that it has been hitherto either so callous,
                    <lb/>that it overlooked this enormity, or so ignorant of its <lb/>own resources,
                    and the true state of the people under <lb/>its authority, as to believe that it
                    had not power to <lb/>effect its abolition.</p>
                <p>The report of a revolution having taken place in <lb/>Chili, is confirmed in
                    letters from Bogota. The <lb/>constitutional Director, Pinto, has been driven
                    out of <lb/>the capital by General Prieto with an armed force, and <lb/>great
                    excesses are said to have been committed.</p>
                <p>A small fleet sailed lately from Cadiz for Havannah, <lb/>with 2000 soldiers on
                    board. The expedition is sup<lb break="no"/>posed by some to be intended for the
                    invasion of <lb/>Mexico ; but it is more likely to find employment in
                    <lb/>keeping down the elements of insurrection in Cuba&#x2013; <lb/>The plot to
                    which we alluded in our last, seems to have <lb/>excited much alarm. Some of the
                    most opulent fa<lb break="no"/>milies in the island, with several lawyers and
                    official <lb/>persons, were concerned in it. Their object was, as we
                    <lb/>conjectured, to convert the island into an independent <lb/>republic.</p>
                <p>From a detailed list published in the French papers, <lb/>it appears that the
                    expedition against Algiers is to be <lb/>composed of 34,000 men, infantry,
                    cavalray, and artil<lb break="no"/>lery.</p>
                <p>Farther intelligence has been received from the ca<lb break="no"/>pital of
                    Colombia to the 14th of February. A warm <lb/>address had been presented by the
                    Congress to Bolivar, <lb/>entreating him not to abandon the republic at a mo<lb
                        break="no"/>ment when its existence was menaced by conspiracies; <lb/>and he
                    seems to have once more consented to remain <lb/>in office. Commissioners had
                    been appointed to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed to Valentia, and endeavour to
                    accomodate the <lb/>differences between the people of Venezuela and the
                    <lb/>central government, by peaceable means. If these <lb/>failed it was
                    determined to employ force. The Congress <lb/>was in session at Bogota, and was
                    proceeding to fulfil the <lb/>object for which it had been assembled, by drawing
                    up <lb/>a new constitution. The bases are published, and though <lb/>the present
                    only an imperfect sketch of its plan, <lb/>they disclose one or two features
                    which seem to be cha<lb break="no"/>racteristic. The government is to be <hi
                        rend="italic">central</hi>, as it has <lb/>hitherto been, not <hi
                        rend="italic">federal</hi> like that of the United States, <lb/>which has
                    served as a model to Mexico, Guatemala, <lb/>and La Plata. In the one case the
                    supreme authority <lb/>is vested in a single legislature, which meets in the
                        ca<lb break="no"/>pital ; in the other it is divided among a number of
                    <lb/>local assemblies, while the general congress represent<lb break="no"/>ing
                    the whole, wields no other powers than what is ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to hold
                    the separate members in a state of <lb/>union. The federal system, which leaves
                    to every pro<lb break="no"/>vince the management of its own conerns, has ad<lb
                        break="no"/>vantages for a settled and enlightened community ; but
                    <lb/>whether it is equally adapted to the circumstances of <lb/>an ignorant
                    people newly escaped from political con<lb break="no"/>vulsions, is very
                    questionable. There seems, how<lb break="no"/>ever, to be a partiality for the
                    federal system in the <lb/>new world ; and to humour this feeling, the new
                        con<lb break="no"/>stitution provides, that "Chambers of Distrcits" shall
                    <lb/>be established, with powers to decide on all municipal <lb/>and local
                    affairs. The difficulty will be, to give these <lb/>bodies the powers necessary
                    to develope the industry <lb/>and resources of the country, without permitting
                    them <lb/>to impose taxes, and exercise other legislative functions, <lb/>which
                    will interfere with the business of the general <lb/>government. Another articl
                    state, that the members <lb/>of the Senate and House of Representatives are to
                    hold <lb/>their seats for a considerable time, in order " to avoid <lb/>the
                    inconveniences resulting from frequent changes, or <lb/>the repeated election of
                    the same person." In the <lb/>mouth of an English statesman, we should consider
                    <lb/>this vile sophistry ; but allowance must be made <lb/>for the <hi
                        rend="italic">res dur? novitas regni</hi>, in a new <lb/>state like
                    Colombia, formed of heterogenous ele<lb break="no"/>ments, among which it is not
                    easy to establish <lb/>any principle of cohesion. One the same grouns, the
                    <lb/>Columbian legislators may be pardoned for resolving <lb/>that the Catholic
                    religion is that of the state, and that <lb/>no other shall be permitted. This
                    is merely a conces<lb break="no"/>cession for the sake of peace, to prejudice
                    which the <lb/>government is not strong enough to subdue, and can<lb break="no"
                    />not defy without great danger. Nothing is said about <lb/>the mode of
                    election, or the power of the Presiden, two <lb/>points of vital consequence,
                    which may give a new <lb/>complexion to the whole scheme. We have made
                    <lb/>these remarks on the proposed constitution, because it <lb/>probably holds
                    out the last chance of composing the <lb/>trouble of Columbia. If it does not
                    satisfy the people <lb/>other provinces will soon follow the example of Vene<lb
                        break="no"/>zuela, and all the address and influence of Bolivar will
                    <lb/>not prevent the republic from splitting into four or <lb/>five independent
                    communities, whose mutual jealousness <lb/>and wars will crush the librties, and
                    destroy the pro<lb break="no"/>sperity of the whole.</p>

                    <lb/>This afternoon the first sale of wools for a long time <lb/>past took place
                    at Garraway's Coffee-house. The <lb/>quantity announced for sale to-day was
                    nearly 200 bales, <lb/>consisting of about 100 bales of New South Wales
                    <lb/>wool, 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools, &amp;c. The <lb/>New South Wales
                    wool was first put up and went off <lb/>very briskly at prices averaging from 1s
                    4 1/2d to 1s 10d <lb/>per lb., which quotations are higher than those last
                    <lb/>obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold <lb/>by order of the Van
                    Dieman's Land Company, being <lb/>a portion of the last arrivals from the
                    Company's flocks. <lb/>They met a very ready sale, and the average prices ob<lb
                        break="no"/>tained were from 1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The arrivals <lb/>from
                    Germany and other places this year are expected <lb/>to be very great.</p>

                    <lb/>appeared in our paper on the excess of females over <lb/>males in the

                    prolonged by their <lb/>better regularity. This is a sly censure upon the ha<lb

                    were supposed by implication to be cut off perma<lb break="no"/>nently by
                    intemperance! We admit that a few hearty <lb/>fellows do go off in apoplexy; but
                    we deny that the <lb/>number bears any proportion to the amount supposed;
                    <lb/>we have two other remarks to make on his state<lb break="no"/>ment. First,
                    since our manners were corrupted by im<lb break="no"/>itating <hi rend="italic"
                        >English</hi> fashions, it is whispered, we hope un<lb break="no"/>, that
                    there are such things as tippling women in <lb/>country, some of whom do
                    disappear suddenly&#x2013;no <lb/>matter how; and secondly, we wish our London
                    friend <lb/>inform us how it happens, that while all Broad <lb/>England has only
                    an excess of 11 1/2 per cent females, <lb/>Edinburgh should have no less than
                    24! We under<lb break="no"/>stand that since this astounding fact was brought
                    out, <lb/>there has been a great efflux of ladies from the city to <lb/>the
                    adjoining counties. We know a number who have <lb/>or are flying to Fife and the
                    north. A friend, who <lb/>careful observer, compares it to the dispersion of
                    <lb/>the Jews. The ladies, he says, attribute their flight to <lb/><hi

                <p>Botany Bay serves as a recipient for criminals whose <lb/>reformation is
                    hopeless, and whom it is therefore desir<lb break="no"/>able to remove from the
                    Society to whose peace and se<lb break="no"/>curity they are sworn enemies. This
                    is the sole value <lb/>of the colony. If it did not exist, recourse would be
                    <lb/>had more frequently to perpetual imprisonment and the <lb/>gibbet.
                    Experience shews, however, that transportation <lb/>does not produce the
                    intended effect of terrifying the <lb/>guilty. Its monitory operation depends
                    greatly on the <lb/>situation of the criminal. "Agricultural labourers <lb/>with
                    families dread it extremely, while to single men, <lb/>mechanics who are sure of
                    receiving high wages, and <lb/>generally to all those who feel a desire of
                    change, and a <lb/>vague expectation of pushing their fortunes, it appears
                    <lb/>to hold out no terrors whatever." In the colony there <lb/>is a competition
                    among settlers to obtain convinct <lb/>servants, and those who get them,
                    endeavour, from <lb/>a regard to their own interest to render the situation
                    <lb/>of the convicts as little irksome as possible. The <lb/>evidence proves,
                    that when the feeling degrada<lb break="no"/>tion is once overcome, the
                    situation of the Australian <lb/>convict "is, in many respects, preferable to
                    that of <lb/>the agricultural labourer in this country :" He <lb/>has better
                    clothing, more abundant food, and en<lb break="no"/>joys a finer climate. The
                    hardship, too, of compulsory <lb/>labour is but for a limited time. The convict
                    who is <lb/>transported for 7 years, is allowed a Ticket of Leave, <lb/>at the
                    end of 8years. Once possessed of this <lb/>ticket he is allowed to work on his
                    own account, and <lb/>with high wages, easily acquires capital. The com<lb
                        break="no"/>mittee see little chance of rendering punishment effec<lb
                        break="no"/>tive in the colony. They recommend various subordi<lb break="no"
                    />nate regulations, and among others, they suggest as a <lb/>remedy for the
                    great expense attending transportation, <lb/>that no convict be assigned to a
                    settler until he shall <lb/>have paid, or given security for the payment by
                        instal<lb break="no"/>ments, of the expense incurred in the conveyance of
                    <lb/>the convict from the mother country.</p>
                <p>We are satisfied that the true check to the increase <lb/>of crime is to be
                    found, first, in the diffusion of educa<lb break="no"/>tion and sound knowledge
                    ; and, second, in the improve<lb break="no"/>ment of our judicial and municipal
                    institutions. Law, <lb/>in all its important branches, should be dispensed by
                    <lb/>paid and responsible persons. A judge ought to <lb/>be stationed in each
                    small district, and keep open <lb/>court every day of the year. He should be
                    chosen <lb/>by some popular constituency, which would faithfully <lb/>represent
                    the feelings of the mass of suitors; and <lb/>as a guarantee for his diligence,
                    he should hold his <lb/>office only for seven years, and be re-eligible. Jus<lb
                        break="no"/>tices of Peace, if retained at all, should be elected <lb/>as in
                    most of the American states, by the householders <lb/>for three, four, or seven
                    years. Jails also, should be <lb/>placed under the controul of popular bodies,
                    and thrown <lb/>open to the improving efforts of private benevolence. <lb/>In
                    this, as in other points, we have much to learn from <lb/>the Americans, who
                    never forget that the criminal is still <lb/>a man. The grand defect in our
                    legislation has been, <lb/>that the rich made laws for the poor, of whose
                    situation <lb/>they had scarcely any knowledge, and with whose feel<lb
                        break="no"/>ings, wants, and moral condition, they had of course no
                    <lb/>sympathy. The unpaid Magistracy of Britain is a bar<lb break="no"/>barism
                    belonging to the tenth century. Thirty years <lb/>hence men will wonder how
                    their forefathers tolerated <lb/>so monstrous a system.</p>

                    <lb/>South Wales to the 8th of January, state that the produce <lb/>of the last
                    year's clip of wool in Australia will be greatest <lb/>than that of the
                    preceding year, and the the quali<lb break="no"/>ty has also considerably
                    improved. From Van Die<lb break="no"/>man's Land it is now ascertained that the

                    <lb/>arrivals of wool are looked for from New South Wales <lb/>and the private
                    contract business is expected to be very <lb/>active. The public sales of wools
                    went off on Friday <lb/>very well, and at full prices. The arrivals of this week
                    <lb/>have consisted of about 708 bales, of which about 292 <lb/>bales were Van
                    Dieman's Land wools, and the rest Ger<lb break="no"/>man. There is a steady
                    demand, and as it is under<lb break="no"/>stood that the manufacturers are short

                    to 6s per piece, compared with what was given at <lb/>the beginning of the year,
                    and three quarter wide are <lb/>proportionably higher. Unless a reduction takes
                    place <lb/>in the price of wool, the manufacturers state they must <lb/>have a

                    was obtained ; several <lb/>sales were effected in fine qualities, and if the

                <p><pb/><hi rend="italic">The Wool Trade.</hi>&#x2013;The whole of the London public
                    <lb/>sales of Colonial and other woold having now been <lb/>gone through, the
                    wool trade is in a more settled state, <lb/>and transactions by private contract
                    are conducted on a <lb/>more extensive scale. The total amount of the late
                    <lb/>sales, the last of which took place on Tuesday, was <lb/>4,000 bales, and
                    the colonial wools were taken by the <lb/>manufactures at the extreme advance
                    realized at the <lb/>previous sales in July. In some cases, indeed, quota<lb
                        break="no"/>tions from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. <lb/>The
                    sales on Saturday was most fully attended, and in<lb break="no"/>creased
                    boldness was observed. The colonial wools <lb/>offered on that day fetched
                    excellent prices. Some few <lb/>bales were also offered, forming a part of the
                    second <lb/>clip of wools in the new colony on the Swan River. <lb/>They were
                    much better in quality than those last re<lb break="no"/>ceived. Some German
                    lambs' wool also commanded <lb/>attention, and sold as high as 3s 10d to 4s per
                    lb. The <lb/>sale on Tuesday (the last of the series,) was not quite <lb/>so
                    fully attended as those of last wekk, but, according <lb/>to quality, full
                    prices were obtained. The sale consisted <lb/>of 437 bales New South Wales and
                    Van Diemen's <lb/>Land wool, 96 bales of Portugal wool, 54 Spanish, and <lb/>72
                    bales of Cape, German, Russian, and other wools. <lb/>The best fleece of
                    Amsterdam offered fetched 2s 10d to <lb/>3s 2d, and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d
                    per lb ; the <lb/>best Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d <lb/>to
                    2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s 4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van <lb/>Diemen's Land 1s 8d to
                    1s 10d ; and the best German <lb/>2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales
                    is to esta<lb break="no"/>blish a much firmer market for wools of all
                    descriptions <lb/>than previously existed. The arrivals of wool are
                    <lb/>limited, and this week only 575 bales of German wool, <lb/>and abotu 375
                    bales of Neapolitan wool have been en<lb break="no"/>tered at the custom house.

                </p>
                <p><hi rend="enlarged-capital">T</hi>he subject of emigration is rising in
                    importance <lb/>from year to year, and cannot lose its interest as long <lb/>as
                    much misery or much discontent exists among our <lb/>working classes. Upper
                    Canada, the great recipient of <lb/>our surplus population, is 4000 miles from
                    Britain, a <lb/>distance which looks extremely formidable ; but such <lb/>is the
                    amazing economy of water carriage, when se<lb break="no"/>conded by good
                    arrangements, that the voyage by sea <lb/>to Montreal can be made at as small
                    expense as the <lb/>journey by land to Manchester ! The passage money <lb/>from
                    Dublin to Montreal or Quebec (exclusive of food) <lb/>has been as low as 30s ;
                    and it would not be higher <lb/>probably from Leith or Greenock, if the
                    emigrants <lb/>were in sufficient numbers, and so prompt in their ar<lb
                        break="no"/>rangements, that the vessel lost no time beyond what <lb/>was
                    strictly necessary for taking her full compliment <lb/>aboard. If the ship is
                    detained a month before this is <lb/>got, the owners must, of course, be
                    indemnified for the <lb/>detention by a higher fare. Four stone of oatmeal,
                    <lb/>with a little ham or salt fish for variety, will subsist a <lb/>man or
                    woman on the voyage ; and thus a human be<lb break="no"/>ing can be conveyed
                    over a distance equal to one-sixth <lb/>part of the circumference of the globe,
                    and six times <lb/>longer, we dare say, than the wanderings of Ulysses, at
                    <lb/>the small coast of 45s !</p>
                <p>In an article in May 1832, we pointed out the rapid <lb/>strides with which
                    emigration was advancing ; and <lb/>some Parliamentary papers we have received
                    since, ex<lb break="no"/>hibit new proofs of its extraordinary progress. It
                    <lb/>has, in fact, outstripped the expectations of the most <lb/>sanguine.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the number of person who <lb/>have emigrated in the
                    last eight years to North America, <lb/>the Cape, and Australia :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>British America. United States. Cape of G. Hope. Australia. Total. <lb/>1825
                    8,714 5,551 114 485 14,891 <lb/>1826 12,818 7,063 116 903 20,900 <lb/>1827 12,
                    14,526 114 715 28,003 <lb/>1828 12,084 12,817 135 1,056 26,092 <lb/>1829 13,307
                    15,678 197 2,916 31,198 <lb/>1830 30,574 24,887 204 1,242 56,907 <lb/>1831
                    58,067 23,418 11 1,561 83,160 <lb/>1832 66,339 32,872 196 3,733 103,140</p>
                <p>It will be seen from this table how steady the in<lb break="no"/>crease of
                    emigration has been, especially to Canada. <lb/>It must be observed, that a
                    great proportion, probably <lb/>more than a half of those who sailed for the
                    United <lb/>States, were destined for the British colonies, and only <lb/>chose
                    that route as the most eligible, on account of the <lb/>facilities which the
                    Hudson and its associated canals <lb/>present for travelling to the upper
                    province. Canada <lb/>and Nova Scotia must have drawn at least 80,000 set<lb
                        break="no"/>tlers from Britain last year ; and yet, such are the ca<lb
                        break="no"/>pacities of these colonies for absorbing population, that
                    <lb/>the price of labour was not lowered in the least degree ; <lb/>and from the
                    previous arrangements made, it is an<lb break="no"/>nounced that a much larger
                    number of persons could <lb/>have been received without inconvenience ! Sanguine
                    <lb/>as we were upon the subject, we did not anticipate that <lb/>emigration
                    could be conducted on such a scale, with <lb/>the extraordinary ease, certainty,
                    and economy now ex<lb break="no"/>emplified. Those who reflect on the distress
                    and <lb/>perplexity which would be produced by land<lb break="no"/>ing the <hi
                        rend="italic">sixth-part</hi> of eighty thousand strangers on <lb/>the
                    shores of Britain in one summer, will appreciate <lb/>the extremely dissimilar
                    condition of a colony which, <lb/>with less than a million inhabitants, can take
                    in <lb/>eighty-thousand new settlers in the same period without
                    <lb/>embarassment or confusion.</p>
                <p>The general result is, that Britain sent off 103,000 <lb/>souls from her
                    population last year, of whom a[?] number <lb/>sailed 7000 miles, a number
                    14,000, and those who <lb/>made the shortest voyage, 4000 miles. The annals of
                    <lb/>emigration afford nothing approaching to this in any <lb/>part of the world
                    ; and yet we may reasonably expect to <lb/>see still greater things
                    atcheived.</p>
                <p>It appears from the various census since 1801, that <lb/>the annual increase in
                    Britain, if no persons left it, <lb/>would be about 350,000; or we may place the
                    fact in <lb/>a more striking light by stating, that <hi rend="italic">there are
                        about a</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">thousand persons more in the three kingdoms every</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">day than there was on the day before</hi>. If by raising
                    <lb/>the habits and ideas of the labouring classes, we could <lb/>get this daily
                    increase reduced one half, and the <lb/>other half could be carried off by
                    emigration&#x2013;if we <lb/>could by this means keep the supply of labour
                        station<lb break="no"/>ary while capital was increasing, a great improvement
                    <lb/>would be effected in the state of the population. Now <lb/>from what has
                    been stated it appears that the emigrants <lb/>who leave our shores annually
                    amount to nearly one<lb break="no"/> third of the annual excess already ; and in
                    a year or <lb/>two there is every probability that it will amount to
                    <lb/>one-half.</p>
                <p>Of 51,200 emigrants who landed at Quebec and <lb/>Montreal last year, 17,500 went
                    from England, <lb/>28,200 from Ireland, and 5,500 from Scotland. In <lb/>the
                    year 1831, the numbers were, from England 10,300, <lb/>Ireland 34,100, Scotland
                    5,300.</p>
                <p>Of the emigrants from Scotland last year, 1716 sail<lb break="no"/>ed from
                    Greenock, 1145 from Leith, 638 from Cro<lb break="no"/>marty, 478 from Aberdeen,
                    439 from Dundee, 231 <lb/>from Alloa, 181 from Islay, 175 from Anna, 160 from
                    <lb/>Glasgow, 112 from Leven, 110 from Campbeltown, <lb/>and numbers under 100
                    from Stanraer, Peterhead, and <lb/>Irvine.</p>
                <p>Of the emigrants to the United States last year <lb/>15,754 sailed from
                    Liverpool, 5,546 from London <lb/>2,742 from Bristol, 2,613 from Londonderry,
                    and <lb/>1,711 from Greenock.</p>
                <p>Mr Buchanan, the Government agent at Quebec, <lb/>states in his Report, that "the
                    general description of <lb/>emigrants who arrived last year ; many respectable
                    and wealthy fa<lb break="no"/>milies came from all part of the united kingdom ;
                    and <lb/>the extent of property and specie brought into the <lb/>country by them
                    is exceedingly great, fully amounting <lb/>to from t600,000 to t700,000
                    sterling." About 5000 <lb/>persons were sent out by pecuniary aid from parishes
                    <lb/>or landlords ; and there were 1700 "commuted pen<lb break="no"/>sioners"
                    (military, we believe), many of them men of <lb/>irregular habits, and ill
                    fitted for the situation of set<lb break="no"/>tlers. Of these, about 100
                    returned to Britain. The <lb/>fear of cholera was a considerable check to
                    emigration. <lb/>It appeared in Quebec on the 8th of June, and the <lb/>persons
                    who arrived after that, suffered much from <lb/>the difficulty of procuring
                    lodgings even for a day ; <lb/>but Mr Buchanan estimates the whole number of
                        emi<lb break="no"/>grants who fell victims to the disease, at no more
                    than</p>
                <p>"The demand for all classes of working people <lb/>(says the Report,) has never
                    been exceeded in the Ca<lb break="no"/>nadas, particularly since the abatement
                    of the cholera, <lb/>and I can assure your Lordship that, during my late
                    <lb/>tour through the districts and settlements of Upper <lb/>Canada, I did not
                    see an industrious emigrant who <lb/>could not meet with emplyment. The number
                    of <lb/>that class arrived this year is not adequate to supply <lb/>the demand
                    created by the more wealthy emigrants. <lb/>This was particularly felt in the
                    Western and London <lb/>districts of the upper province, where the want of la<lb
                        break="no"/>bourers was so great that it was found necessary to en<lb
                        break="no"/>courage a number to come over from Ohio and Pen<lb break="no"
                    />nsylvania." This was written on the 12th Dec. 1832, <lb/>and the arrival of
                    emigrants closed in October.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The following document has just been issued from the <lb/>Colonial
                    Office:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>Downing street, April 6, 1834. <lb/>Numerous applicants have been received from
                        per<lb break="no"/>sons desirous of emigrating to New South Wales or Van
                    <lb/>Dieman's Land, who, after stating their inability to de<lb break="no"/>fray
                    the whole charge of their conveyance, solicit aid <lb/>for that purpose, on
                    condition of repaying the same out <lb/>of their earnings in the colony where
                    they propose to <lb/>settle. His Majesty's government has sanctioned the
                    <lb/>appropriate of a limited sum out of the colonial reve<lb break="no"/>nues
                    of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, to <lb/>assist the private funds of
                    such emigrants as may ap<lb break="no"/>pear likely to earn the means of repayig
                    that aid, and <lb/>to become useful settlers. The following are the re<lb
                        break="no"/>gulations under which this induglence will be dispens<lb
                        break="no"/>ed:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>No advance will be made except to young and mar<lb break="no"/>ried agricultural
                    labourers, who intend taking their <lb/>wives and families with them : and a
                    strict inquiry will <lb/>be instituted into their character and habits of
                    industry, <lb/>before the assistance they solicit will be granted to them.</p>
                <p>No one family will be allowed an advance exceeding <lb/>t20; and it will be
                    useful therefore for parties, who <lb/>may not possess the remainder of the sum
                    requisite for <lb/>defraying the expense of their passage, to apply for as<lb
                        break="no"/>sistance.</p>
                <p>Every person desirous of receiving the proposed ad<lb break="no"/>vance must fill
                    up, and send back to the Under Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State for the
                    Colonial Department, the return <lb/>hereto annexed. If the information
                    contained in this <lb/>return, and the answers to the inquiries which may be
                    <lb/>addressed to the parties who certify the correctness of <lb/>the return,
                    shall be considered satisfactory, the appli<lb break="no"/>cant will receive
                    notice to that effect. He may then <lb/>proceed to make his agreement with the
                    owners or <lb/>masters of ships proceeding to New South Wales or <lb/>Van
                    Diemen's land, and as soon as any ship-owner <lb/>or master shall notify (in a
                    form which will be provided <lb/>for that purpose) that the emigrant has taken
                    the other <lb/>necessary steps for engaging his passage, and order will <lb/>be
                    granted for the payment in the colony, of t20 to the <lb/>agent or master of the
                    vessel in which this emigrant <lb/>may arrive. The emigrant will of course be
                    able to[?] ob-[?] <lb/>tain a corresponding deduction from the amount[?] [?]
                    <lb/>paid by himself in this country.</p>
                <p>The order for payment will be entrusted [?] <lb/>ter of the vessel in which the
                    emigrants to pro[?] <lb/>and will consist of a sealed dispatch to the governor,
                    <lb/>containing the name and description of the party on <lb/>whose account the
                    money is to be paid, and encolosing a <lb/>promissory note, which he will be
                    required to sign in <lb/>acknowledgement of his debt ; which note must be wit<lb
                        break="no"/>nessed by the captain and chief mate of the vessel. But
                    <lb/>arrangements will be made, by which the payment of <lb/>this order will not
                    take place in the colony until the <lb/>captain shall have produced the parties,
                    on whose ac<lb break="no"/>count it is to be made, before the officer appointed
                    for <lb/>that purpose, and they shall have entered into a fresh <lb/>obligation
                    for the repayment of the advance made to <lb/>them. For it is the intention of
                    his Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and cannot be too clearly understoof
                    by all per<lb break="no"/>sons who may accept this loan, that repayments of the
                    <lb/>debt (in such proportions and at such intervals as may <lb/>not be
                    unsuitable to the circumstances of each emi<lb break="no"/>grant) shall be
                    strictly enforced, by means of the ample <lb/>powers which the laws of the
                    colony render available <lb/>for that purpose.</p>
                <p>Government agents for emigration have been appoint<lb break="no"/>ed at
                    Liverpool, Bristol, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Bel<lb break="no"/>fast, and
                    Greenock, who have been instructed to afford <lb/>gratuitous information to all
                    persons applying to them <lb/>as to the best means of carrying their schemes of
                        emi<lb break="no"/>gration into effect. Parties, therefore, who may reside
                    <lb/>in the neighbourhood of these agents are requested to <lb/>apply to them
                    either personally (or if by letter post <lb/>paid) for information on this
                    subject.</p>
                <p>All application for the assistance of government must <lb/>be made by letter
                    only, addressed to R. W. Hay, Esq. <lb/>Under Secretary of State, London ; and
                    should the <lb/>number of applications be greater than the funds at <lb/>their
                    disposal will enable them to comply with, priority <lb/>of date will form the
                    rule of selection among applications <lb/>in which there shall appear no other

                <p>A meeting of the members of the South Australian Asso<lb break="no"/>ciation was
                    held on Monday, at Exeter Hall, "for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of explaining
                    the principles, objects, plan, and prospects <lb/>of a new colony," proposed to
                    be founded in South Australia. <lb/>Mr W. Whitmore in the chair.</p>
                <p>Upon taking the chair, Mr Whitmore stated, that the first <lb/>question which the
                    meeting would have to consider would be <lb/>this&#x2013;whether there existed
                    or not at present any necessity <lb/>for a more extended system of colonization.
                    It appeared to <lb/>him that there was a great defect in our present system of
                    <lb/>colonication, and that it would be greatly to our advantage if <lb/>we
                    established it upon a new principle, well and seriously <lb/>considered. That
                    which struck him as the greatest defect <lb/>was, that we did not provided that
                    colonization which in<lb break="no"/>cluded within it members of all classes of
                    society. Large <lb/>numbers of emigrants went out with capital, but not carry<lb
                        break="no"/>ing with them that number of the lower class which was
                    <lb/>necessary to employ their capital to advantage. In other <lb/>cases,
                    perhaps almost as numerous, the labourer went out <lb/>without capital which was
                    necessry to enable him to employ <lb/>his labour to advantage. This was a
                    striking defect. Now <lb/>the question which they were then called upon to
                    consider, <lb/>regarded the best means of remedying that defect. Those
                    <lb/>means, it appeared to him, were quite practicable, and might <lb/>be
                    accomplished in this manner, vz. by establishing as a sys<lb break="no"/>tem
                    that all the waste lands which they were about to colo<lb break="no"/>nize
                    should be sold at a given price, such as the market would <lb/>command, and that
                    the proceeds of such sales should be <lb/>employed in sending out to the
                    colonies a sufficient number <lb/>of labourers to cultivate the lands so sold.
                    If this system <lb/>could be carried into effect, he apprehended that all the
                    evils <lb/>of our present system of colonization would be removed, and <lb/>that
                    we should be enabled to transplant a portion of the com<lb break="no"/>munity of
                    the mother country with all its various grades into <lb/>the new country which
                    they now proposed to coloniz. He <lb/>believed that if we proceeded upon this
                    principle, we should <lb/>lay the foundation of the greatest colony which
                    England had <lb/>ever settled.</p>
                <p>Mr Grote, M.P., moved the first resolution,&#x2013;"That the <lb/>wealth and
                    prosperity of this country have been greatly pro<lb break="no"/>moted by the
                    establishment of British colonies in various <lb/>parts of the world, and that
                    colonization, when conducted <lb/>systematically and upon sound principles,
                    offers the means of <lb/>extending indefinitely the commercial empire of the
                    united <lb/>kingdom, and the field of employment for British capital and
                    <lb/>labour." He would not enter into the recommendations <lb/>which this
                    undertaking offered to all classes of the communi<lb break="no"/>ty ; but he
                    would venture to state, that to any gentleman <lb/>who considered the prospectus
                    which had been put out by the <lb/>association, and who recollected that it was
                    a matter of cer<lb break="no"/>tainty that the land in the colony was to be used
                    as the means <lb/>of raising a fund to carry over thither the labour, which was
                    <lb/>superabundant here, it must be evident that from this impor<lb break="no"
                    />tant innovation on our colonial system great benefit must be <lb/>derived[?]
                    both to the new colony and to the mother country.</p>
                <p>Mr Clay, M.P., in seocnding the resolution, entered at <lb/>great length into the
                    difficulty of finding employment, which <lb/>now prevails in all parts of the
                    community, and then, after <lb/>condemning the corn laws, continued
                    thus&#x2013;Colonization, if <lb/>carried on to a considerable extent, would as
                    effectually add <lb/>millions of fertile acres to our shores as if the Irish sea
                    were <lb/>filled up with fertile land. If that miracle took place is it <lb/>not
                    clear that all distress would immediately cease, and that <lb/>the emplyment
                    which the addition of so many fertile acres <lb/>would afford must give a new
                    stimulus to the prosperity of <lb/>the country ? Is it not clear that the
                    miserable compotation[?] <lb/>for potato-gardens in Ireland would cease, and
                    that the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties flowing from an unemployed population
                    would cease ? <lb/>Does any man doubt that it would be well worth the while of
                    <lb/>our capitalists to take such land at from 10s to 20s an acre. <lb/>(Hear.)
                    Yet this plan is in effect the same as if the land were <lb/>added to our own
                    island, because, if this plan of colonization <lb/>be adopted, a transplantation
                    of a sufficiency of labourers, <lb/>now wanting employment, from this country,
                    for its culture, <lb/>will take place, which is equivalent to the transportation
                    of <lb/>the land to the labourer. In point of fact, the ocean joins <lb/>these
                    distant lands, instead of separating them. (Hear.)&#x2013; <lb/>There can be no
                    doubt but that a wider comercial code, and <lb/>the removal of restrictions on
                    labour, would greatly facilitate, <lb/>extend, and increase the commercial
                    intercourse between the <lb/>old nation of the world ; but in no case would the
                    increase <lb/>be in proportion to that which might be calculated on, as the
                    <lb/>consequence of a connection with newly-formed countries in <lb/>other
                    climates. As regards the establishment of colonies, it <lb/>is virtually an
                    extension of the mother country.</p>
                <p>Colonel Torrens, M.P., proposed the second resolution&#x2013; <lb/>"That in
                    establishing colonies, great care ought to be taken <lb/>to combine labour and
                    capital with land, in such propor<lb break="no"/>tions as are best calculated to
                    insure the prosperity of all <lb/>classes of society, and that, in establishing
                    modern colonies, <lb/>this important consideration has been so generally
                        overlook<lb break="no"/>ed." It was, he said, almost unnecessary for him to
                    state that <lb/>in all systems of colonization, land, labour, and capital, ought
                    <lb/>to be combinedin just proportions ; and yet this simple prin<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ciple had been hitherto greatly neglected by those who had <lb/>led new
                    colonies from the mother country. In the first place, <lb/>the whole of the land
                    of this colony was to be public land. <lb/>No individual was to obtain a single
                    acre by gift. There was <lb/>to be no patronage, no job&#x2013;all were to be on
                    a footing of <lb/>equality, and nobody was to have a single inch of land for
                    <lb/>nothing. There would also be another advantage in this sys<lb break="no"
                    />tem, which would arise in the following :&#x2013;In other co<lb break="no"
                    />lonies, the labourer who had gone out and found that he could <lb/>get land
                    for nothing, had often fallen into the mistake that <lb/>land was wealth,
                    instead of it being merely the means of <lb/>producing wealth. That fatal
                    mistake had often led him to <lb/>refuse the work of the master with whom he had
                    gone out, <lb/>and set up for himself as an independent landowner. He had
                    <lb/>in consequence set up, where he was far away from the mar<lb break="no"
                    />ket of the colony, where he had no roads over which to convey <lb/>his
                    produce, and where he had perished miserably. But in <lb/>this colony the
                    labourers would be compelled for some time <lb/>to work for hire.</p>
                <p>Mr Guest, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
                <p>Mr Hutt, M.P. moved the third resolution to the following
                    <lb/>effect:&#x2013;"That in order to promote the greatest prosperity of <lb/>a
                    new colony, it is expedient that all waste land, without any <lb/>exception,
                    shall be declared public land, and be disposed of to <lb/>individuals by sale
                    only, and according to an uniform, impar<lb break="no"/>tial, and permanent
                    system."</p>
                <p>Captain Gowan seconded the resolution, and spoke in the <lb/>highest terms of the
                    salubrity of the climate of Australia. <lb/>Many of his fellow soldiers in India
                    had gone there for the <lb/>recovery of their health, and had found something so
                        tem<lb break="no"/>perate and soothing in the country, that they had retired
                    <lb/>there altogeher, preferring its mild and gentle breeze to the <lb/>chills
                    of their native country, England.</p>
                <p>Mr P. Scrope, M.P. moved "That it is also desirable that <lb/>the whole of the
                    purchase money of public land, without any <lb/>deduction, should be employed in
                    providing a free passage <lb/>from the mother country to the colony, of young
                    adult per<lb break="no"/>sons of the labouring class, who may be willing to
                    emigrate, <lb/>and in equal proportion of both sexes." As the want of
                    <lb/>labour was the great difficulty in all infant colonies, the <lb/>more
                    labour they imported, the greater labour did they give <lb/>their land ; the
                    more they got for the sale of it, the greater <lb/>was their power of importing
                    fresh labour. This resolution, <lb/>therefore, acted in a reciprocal manner upon
                    itself, and when <lb/>it was once fairly put into operation they would proceed
                        on<lb break="no"/>wards on the road to prosperity with accelerated velocity,
                    <lb/>meeting with no other obstacle than the unwillingness of <lb/>England to
                    part with her inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Mr Wilks, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
                <p>Mr Handson moved &#x2013;"That amongst the unoccupied por<lb break="no"/>tions of
                    the earth which form part of the British dominions, <lb/>the south coast of
                    Australia appears to be a sport peculiarly <lb/>suitable for founding a colony
                    upon the principles embodied <lb/>in the preceding resolutions." The place where
                    this colony <lb/>was to be founded was one distinguished from every other
                    <lb/>part of Australia, from its possessing a facility of internal
                    <lb/>communications prior even to the formation of roads, and <lb/>the soil
                    would amply repay the labour expended on its culti<lb break="no"/>vation.</p>
                <p>Mr Robert Owen (not of Lanark) said that the coasts of <lb/>this colony abounded
                    with whales, and that its whale fishe<lb break="no"/>ries might become
                    valuable.</p>
                <p>Mr M. D. Hill rose to propose the resolution embodying the <lb/>mode of carrying
                    the principles of this association into effect. <lb/>No colony could go on
                    without some law. He did not care <lb/>how little they had of it, provided they
                    made up in quality <lb/>what was deficient in quantity. The hon. member entered
                    <lb/>into an elaborate description of the laws intended to be enact<lb
                        break="no"/>ed for the colony, and concluded by moving&#x2013;"That the
                    <lb/>provisions for the peace, order, and good government of the <lb/>British
                    Province of South Australia, as contained in the bill <lb/>now before
                    Parliament, are highly satisfactory."</p>
                <p>Mr D. Wakefield seconded the resolution.</p>
                <p>Sir W. Molesworth, M.P. proposed, and Mr Childers, M.P., <lb/>seconded the
                    following resolution :&#x2013;"That it is the opinion <lb/>of this meeting that
                    the thanks of the country are due to Mr <lb/>Spring Rice for his prompt and
                    enlightened conduct in pro<lb break="no"/>moting the beneficial public object of
                    the South Australian <lb/>Association."</p>
                <p>The resolutions were carried unanimously. Thanks were <lb/>given to the Chairman,
                    and the meeting, at which many <lb/>ladies were present, broke up. The
                    proceedings lasted from <lb/>twelve o'clock to a quarter before five.</p>

                <p>On the order of the day for the third reading of the Univer<lb break="no"
                    />sities' Admission bill being moved&#x2013;</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Herriks[?]</hi> took the occasion of calling on
                    Government to <lb/>explain the circumstances which had occurred in certain
                    <lb/>transactions between the Board of Controul and the East India
                    <lb/>directors. These transactions, the hon. gentleman stated, to <lb/>be the
                    repeated peremptory commands of the Board of Con<lb break="no"/>troul to the
                    Directors of the East India Company to prepare <lb/>a despatch for the purpose
                    of directing the Indian Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to compel the King of Oude,
                    to pay certain claims made <lb/>on him on behalf of Calcutta bankers, which
                    commands the <lb/>Court of Directors refused to obey, on the ground that the
                        in<lb break="no"/>terference which the Board of Controul required them to
                        ex<lb break="no"/>ercise with the King of Oude, was inconsistent with the
                        re<lb break="no"/>lations subsisting between the British Government and the
                    <lb/>King of Oude, and would be most mischievous in effect. On <lb/>the 31st of
                    January the right jon. gentleman had appliedfor, <lb/>and obtained a rule to
                    show cause why, under the act of Par<lb break="no"/>liament, a <hi rend="italic"
                        >mandamus</hi> should not issue to compel the Court <lb/>of Directors to
                    comply with the desire ofthe Board of Con<lb break="no"/>troul. On the 31st of
                    January, 1834, the Court of King's <lb/>bench was prepared to give its decision
                    upon the application <lb/>for the <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi>, when, without
                    any reason being assigned, <lb/>the right hon. President of the Board of
                    Controul withdrew <lb/>his application.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Grant</hi> said that in the regret which had been
                        express<lb break="no"/>ed respecting the possible collision between the two
                    authorities, <lb/>he fully concurred; bu, entertaining such a sentiment, he
                    <lb/>confessed it surprised him not a little to find his Right Hon. <lb/>Friend
                    endeavouring to open a dispute already composed. <lb/>The right honourable
                    gentleman then proceeded to give <lb/>a brief outline of the case, and referred
                    to the various high <lb/>authorities connected with India, who had declared in
                    favour <lb/>of the demand. With regard to his having withdrawn the ap<lb
                        break="no"/>plication for the <hi rend="italic">mandamus</hi> without
                    explanation, he had to <lb/>say that he fully explain his opinions to the
                    Directors, <lb/>he had re-stated them verbally to the chairman, and he did
                    <lb/>not think himself required, under the circumstances, to re<lb break="no"/>
                    enter into a long discussion upon the point. The effect of the
                    <lb/>recommendation to the King of Oude was merely to urge the <lb/>claim upon
                    his attention.</p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Peel</hi> said it was a perfectly novel doctrine, and
                    in the <lb/>present state of the world most inconvenient, that the non<lb
                        break="no"/>payment of debts due to his subjects should give the King of
                    <lb/>England a right forcibly to intervene with foreign states, ex<lb break="no"
                    />cept where sanctioned by positive treaty.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Hume</hi> contended, that on the whole, the debt was a
                    just <lb/>one, and ought to be paid.</p>
                <p>The subject here dropped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Admission of Dissenters to the Universities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>On the question that this bill be read a third time,</p>
                <p>Mr T. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gladstone</hi> rose to oppose it. It would, he said,
                    be <lb/>useless to pass the bill, for it would of necessity be inopera<lb
                        break="no"/>tive. If he were asked why he opposed a bill which, if pass<lb
                        break="no"/>ed, would be inoperative, his answer was that he objected
                    <lb/>to its principle, the admission of which was equally destruc<lb break="no"
                    />tive, whether it effected the object of its promoters or not. <lb/>Further,
                    they were bound to respect corporate rights as long <lb/>as the intentions of
                    their founders were fulfilled ; and no one <lb/>could deny that the Universities
                    did fulfilthe intentions of <lb/>their founders." (Hear, hear.)</p>
                <p>Mr V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Smith</hi> supported the bill, as one calculated to
                    take <lb/>away a reproach from the Establishment, and be felt as a
                    <lb/>compliment by the Dissenters, whose only desire was to exer<lb break="no"
                    />cise their vigorous intellects in the promotion of science <lb/>and
                    literature.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Baines</hi> said, that the original statutes showed that
                    there <lb/>were then no tests, nor did any exist at Oxford, in either the
                    <lb/>time of the Lollards or of Wickliff. The term University had <lb/>in it an
                    argument for thegeneral use of these seats of learn<lb break="no"/>ing, which
                    were meant to be universal, both as to the sub<lb break="no"/>jects taught, and
                    the persons to whom they were communi<lb break="no"/>cated. In this sense, the
                    term was understood and applied in <lb/>other countries, and it was an
                    extraordinary fact, deserving <lb/>of attention, that the Universities of Oxford
                    and of Cambridge <lb/>were the only universities that were closed to a large
                        pro<lb break="no"/>portion of the upper classes of the people in any country
                    in <lb/>Europe. This the Dissenters of England felt as a grievous
                    <lb/>indignity, and they thought it unjust that Englishmen should <lb/>attempt
                    to degrade Englishmen by excluding them from the <lb/>best seats of literature
                    and science.</p>
                <p>Mr H. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hughes</hi> could not accede to the measure, and
                        there<lb break="no"/>fore moved that it be read that day six months.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">Goulburn</hi> contended that the introduction of the
                        Dis<lb break="no"/>senters, as proposed under the present bill, would be
                    nothing <lb/>short of the destruction of the present system of education at
                    <lb/>the Universities. It was indisputable that at a University, re<lb
                        break="no"/>ligion could only be taught according to some set form :
                    <lb/>abandon that mode of tuition, and you abandon the religion <lb/>itself.
                    (Cries of "No, no.") If they let in Dissenters, it was <lb/>perfectly obvious
                    the intentions of the founders of those es<lb break="no"/>tablishments would be
                    completely defeated : he therefore de<lb break="no"/>precated the measures as
                    injurious to religon and opposed to <lb/>the best interest of the country.</p>
                <p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerstone</hi>, Sir R. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Inglis</hi>, and Mr G. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wood</hi> then <lb/>addressed
                    the house, but amidst such discordant noises as <lb/>prevented what they said
                    being heard. The laughing, jeer<lb break="no"/>ing, shouting, were such as has
                    seldom been heard. In par<lb break="no"/>ticular two hon. members who entered
                    from the smoking <lb/>room into the opposite gallery during the address of Mr
                    <lb/>Wood, and who stretched themselves at full length on the <lb/>seats secure
                    from the observation of the Speaker, kept up a <lb/>row of the most
                    discreditable character. The Speaker, with <lb/>much indignation in his tone and
                    manner, called the parties <lb/>to order.</p>
                <p>The motion for the third reading was carried, on a division, <lb/>by 164 to 25. <cb/>
                    <lb/>The Trading Companies Bill, the Arms Importation (Ire<lb break="no"/>land)
                    Bill, and the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bill, went <lb/>through
                    committees.</p>
                <p>The Four Courts (Dublin) Bill, the Weights and Measures <lb/>Bill, and the
                    Turnpike Acts Amendment Bill, were read a <lb/>third time and passed.</p>
                <p>The Almanack Stamps Repeal Bill, the Assessed Taxes <lb/>Repeal Bill, and the
                    Militia Ballot Suspension Bill, were <lb/>brought in, and read a first time.</p>
                <p>The house was counted out at three o'clock in the morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Tuesday, July 29.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">John Cam Hobhouse</hi> and General Sir <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Edward Barnes</hi>, <lb/>took the oaths and their seats ;
                    the former for Nottingham, in <lb/>the room of Lord Duncannon, raised to the
                    Peerage ; the <lb/>latter for Sudbury, in the room of M. A. Taylor, Esq.
                    deceased.</p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr Alderman <hi rend="smallcaps">Thompson</hi> the Durham and
                    <lb/>Sunderland Railway bill was read a third time and passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Southern Australia</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rice</hi> moved the order of the day for the house
                    <lb/>to resolve into Committee upon the Bill for the Colonization <lb/>of
                    Southern Australia,</p>
                <p>Mr A.<hi rend="smallcaps">Baring</hi> rose and stated various objections to the
                        pro<lb break="no"/>ject. The hon. member contended that at this period of
                    the <lb/>year there was not time to deliberate upon such an important
                    <lb/>subject, and, independent of this preliminary objection, he <lb/>said he
                    did not conceive that government ought to sanction <lb/>any such experiment
                    without a full conviction that there was <lb/>a reasonable probability of its
                    success. In his opinion the <lb/>experiment was founded upon bases more mistaken
                    than any <lb/>similar one which had ever been tried. In fact, according to
                    <lb/>the plan which had been laid down, the colony would be tied <lb/>up by
                    mortgages in such a way, that it would not again re<lb break="no"/>vert to the
                    Crown, so that the territory would be lost. The <lb/>result would be, that if
                    the gentlemen who set the project on <lb/>foot were mistaken&#x2013;as he was
                    sure they had been&#x2013;we would <lb/>be prevented from touching this large
                    portion of Australia, <lb/>unless we could pay off the debt which had been
                    contracted. <lb/>While he stated these objections to the plan, he was anxious
                    <lb/>not to be understood to be inimical to colonization, for <lb/>he was very
                    favourable to it. Every new opening to co<lb break="no"/>lonization he was
                    convinced was a substantial benefit to the <lb/>poorer classes, (Hear, hear,
                    hear.) It was not, therefore, <lb/>to the principle of colonization that he was
                    opposed, <lb/>but he objected to this bill becaue the plan was a most
                    <lb/>mistaken one, and would eventually shut up this large <lb/>portion of the
                    world. One of his main objections was to the <lb/>extent to which it was
                    proposed to carry the experiment. Let <lb/>the gentlemen take, if they like, 100
                    square miles, but let <lb/>them not risk the whole of a great continent. People,
                    like <lb/>fuel, he said, could not well be carried too far ; they might <lb/>get
                    a few thousands to go out, but they would never get the <lb/>tens of thousands
                    to go which were required for the success of <lb/>the project. The hon. member
                    then objected to two of the <lb/>principles which were laid down by the
                    projectors, that land <lb/>should not be sold lower than 12s. per acre, and that
                    no credit <lb/>should be given. He was convinced that any man acquainted
                    <lb/>with the practical workings of the system in other colonies, <lb/>would
                    blow up the whole plan in a moment. No man who <lb/>went out to Australia would
                    think of taking less than two <lb/>hundred acres. Now that would cost him t120;
                    it would <lb/>cost him t120 more to get himself and his family over; which,
                    <lb/>with stock and other expenses, would amount to t500 or t600. <lb/>He would,
                    therefore, ask any gentlemen in that house, whe<lb break="no"/>ther they thought
                    any man who had t500 or t600 in this <lb/>country, would go out and set himself
                    down on two hundred <lb/>acres in Australia. (Hear, hear.) He therefore
                    suggested to <lb/>his right hon. friend to consent that the committee be post<lb
                        break="no"/>poned until another session, and then have it referred to a
                    <lb/>select committee. He concluded by moving, as an amend<lb break="no"/>ment,
                    that the bill be committed on that day six months.</p>
                <p>Mr W. <hi rend="smallcaps">Whitmore</hi> was thakful for the very candid manner
                    <lb/>in which the hon. member had stated his objections to the bill. <lb/>With
                    respect to the large extent of territory, he (Mr W.) <lb/>thought that was
                    necessary, as it was intended to introduce a <lb/>completely new system of
                    colonization&#x2013;one very different from <lb/>any thing ever before
                    attempted. The extent of land it was <lb/>intended to take under this act was
                    from 500,000 to 600,000 <lb/>square miles, and it was the leading principle of
                    the bill that <lb/>all the money arising from the sale of lands should be
                    applied <lb/>to the purpose of sending out labourers free of expense.&#x2013;
                    <lb/>(Hear, hear, hear.) If this plan succeeded, there would be a <lb/>constant
                    stream of emigrants going out. The land sold by the <lb/>Canada Company had been
                    at a higher price. He had san<lb break="no"/>guine hopes that all the money it
                    would be necessary to <lb/>borrow would be easily repaid. He most conscientously
                        con<lb break="no"/>sidered that this bill would prove a very great benefit
                    to the <lb/>country. It would tend exceedingly towards facilitating and
                    <lb/>amending the conditions of the people of England and Ireland, <lb/>and
                    therefore he hoped it would pass.</p>
                <p>Mr <hi rend="smallcaps">O'Dwyer</hi> contended that, before the house thought of
                    <lb/>agreeing to such a bill as this, they ought to do something <lb/>towards
                    the ameloriation of the condition of the people of <lb/>Ireland. The various
                    reports which committees of that house <lb/>had made, showed that one-fourth of
                    the land of that country <lb/>was untilled, but was at the same time what was
                    called re<lb break="no"/>claimable land, and well calculated for the cultivation
                    and <lb/>produce of grain. Let this country advance some of the sur<lb
                        break="no"/>plus capital talked of by the hon. member towards the culti<lb
                        break="no"/>vation of this bog land, and discontent would flee[?] from
                        Ire<lb break="no"/>land entirely. The Irish people wanted employment, give
                    <lb/>them that and the house would hear no more about murders, <lb/>fires, and
                    other outrages.</p>
                <p>Mr S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rice</hi> in reference to the allusion made by the
                    hon. <lb/>and learned member, begged to say that, although much of <lb/>the bog
                    land in question belonged to private individuals, yet a <lb/>portion of it was
                    the property of the Government, who had <lb/>been, and still were, making
                    experiments, with a view to as<lb break="no"/>certain if the views of the
                    Commissioners could be carried into <lb/>effect. With respect to the manner in
                    which the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Essex had opened this question, he
                    must confess that <lb/>he had brought with him much of usefulness and of
                        experi<lb break="no"/>ence, and of such a character, too, as could not fail
                    to carry <lb/>weight. The right hon. gentleman then proceeded to speak <lb/>in
                    favour of the proposed colonization of South Australia</p>
                <p>After some farther discussion, strangers were ordered to <lb/>withdraw, and the
                    house divided, when there appeared&#x2013;For <lb/>going into committee, 72;
                    against it 7&#x2013;Majority, 65.</p>
                <p>The bill went through the committee. The report was re<lb break="no"/>ceived, and
                    ordered to be taken into further consideration on <lb/>Thursday next.</p>
                <p>Several petitions were presented, and, at three o'clock, the <lb/>Speaker left
                    the chair.</p>

                <p><pb/>Colonel C. J. Napier has been appointed Governor <lb/>of the embryo colony
                    in South Australia, and we be<lb break="no"/>lieve that a fitter appointment
                    could not have been <lb/>made. We only regret that Colonel Napier has not
                    <lb/>been sent to superintend a colony founded on some<lb break="no"/>thing like
                    sane principles. But if this Austra<lb break="no"/>lian project end, as we have
                    little doubt it will do, <lb/>in the ruin of those who are weak and silly enough
                    to <lb/>embark in it, no one will ascribe any part of the fail<lb break="no"
                    />ure to the incapacity or unfitness of the Governor. <lb/>The whole blame will
                    fall on the contrivers of the <lb/>scheme.</p>

                <p>There have been 300 convents suppressed within <lb/>the last three years. The

                    King of Prussia, who, by a royal <lb/>order, secularised all the convents in the
                    Duchy of <lb/>Posen. In 1834, Don Pedro put down 300 convents, <lb/>and Spain

                        adver<lb break="no"/>tisement in to-day's paper, that Government are fitting
                    <lb/>another ship for the <hi rend="italic">free</hi> conveyance of single
                    females <lb/>from London to Van Dieman's Land ; and from the <lb/>great demand
                    for agricultural labourers, and mecha<lb break="no"/>nics of every description,
                    in that colony, it has been <lb/>resolved to grant a passage to that class, at a
                    cost not <lb/>above what is paid to America&#x2013;Government paying <lb/>the
                    remainder of the sum as a bounty, amounting to <lb/>t30, which may certainly be
                    looked upon as a great <lb/>boon, both by individuals and the colony at large.
                    In <lb/>all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of work<lb break="no"
                    />ing people, as from an official document in our posses<lb break="no"/>sion, it
                    is asserted, on authority, that in Upper Canada <lb/>agricultural labourers,
                    domestic servants, and trades<lb break="no"/>men of every description, will be
                    for some years in <lb/>great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from
                    <lb/>t25 to t30 per annum, with board, lodging, and <lb/>washing, and
                    day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day, <lb/>with provisions. The government
                    agent for emigra<lb break="no"/>tion for the Canadas asserts he could find
                        imme<lb break="no"/>diate employment for 20,000 working people, as pub<lb
                        break="no"/>lic improvements are much retarded for want of hands. <lb/>As
                    this is the best season, we would advise all those <lb/>intending to emigrate to
                    apply to the government <lb/>agent for emigration at the Custom House, Leith,
                    <lb/>who will give gratuitous information regarding the <lb/>colonies, and
                    advise as to the best method of putting <lb/>their plans into execution. The

                <p><pb n="2"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Australian Colonies</hi>.&#x2013;We have seen a
                        print<lb break="no"/>ed circular containing extracts of a letter from Mr
                    <lb/>John Sullivan, surgeon-superintendent of the Emi<lb break="no"/>grant ship
                        <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi>, dated Sydney, 6th October 1835,
                    <lb/>addressed to Edward Forster, Esq. chairman of the <lb/>Emigration
                    Committee, London. In this letter Mr <lb/>Sullivan mentions that the female
                    emigrants, on land<lb break="no"/>ing, were placed in spacious and commodious
                        build<lb break="no"/>ings, adjoining the Government House, at Syd<lb
                        break="no"/>ney, where every attention was paid to their com<lb break="no"
                    />fort and security from improper intrusion. The <lb/>writer further states
                    :&#x2013;" We landed in Sydney a <lb/>greater proportion of well conducted,
                    industrious, and <lb/>virtuous young women, than were ever before landed
                    <lb/>from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee <lb/>that came to these
                    Colonies. Three-fourths of the <lb/>young women were engaged, and went into
                        comfort<lb break="no"/>able situations, on the first and second days after
                        land<lb break="no"/>ing ; and before a week all the useful and good ser<lb
                        break="no"/>vants, viz. laundresses, cooks, servants of all work,
                    <lb/>dairymaids, and housekeepers, were in places, many <lb/>of them in Syndey
                    and the surroundings districts ; se<lb break="no"/>veral were taken up the
                    country to Maitland and <lb/>Bathurst ; and as many more cooks, laundresses,
                        dairy<lb break="no"/>maids, or farm servants as we had, could obtain places
                    <lb/>in that time, for these are the descriptions of female <lb/>servants in
                    demand throughout the colony. The <lb/>wages varied from t8 to t20. Some, who
                    were not <lb/>very good servants of all work and housemaids, got <lb/>t8 to t10
                    ; cooks and laundresses, t12 to t16 (the <lb/>latter are much wanted) ;
                    housemaids and needlewo<lb break="no"/>men, t10 to t12 ; housekeepers, t16 to
                    t20. Go<lb break="no"/>vernesses also are much sought for it ; if we had had
                    <lb/>twenty qualified they could have got situations in <lb/>respectable
                    families and schools ; but the salaries to <lb/>this class are small, say t25 to
                    t40. Nursery gover<lb break="no"/>nesses got t20. All the male emigrants who
                        under<lb break="no"/>stood agriculture, or the management of stock in ge<lb
                        break="no"/>neral, but particularly sheep, were engaged imme<lb break="no"
                    />diately, at salaries varying from t40 to t50, with a <lb/>house and rations
                    for family use." We understand <lb/>that the <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi> had a
                    number of females from Edin<lb break="no"/>burgh and its neighbourhood, and the
                    above informa<lb break="no"/>tion must be highly satisafactory to their

                    landed at <lb/>Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 <lb/>and 1832

                    <lb/>years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by <lb/>parochial aid. The

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Theatre</hi>.&#x2013;Mr C. Kean concluded his en<lb
                        break="no"/>gagement on Thursday evening&#x2013;an engagement <lb/>the
                    longest and most brilliant of any that our <lb/>Theatre has witnessed for many
                    years. Mr Kean <lb/>has been with us for a whole month, and has suc<lb
                        break="no"/>ceeded in crowding the house almost every night. <lb/>We
                    understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have <lb/>visited the theatre during
                    his engagement&#x2013;a number <lb/>beyond that of any former period of equal
                    duration. <lb/>In that time he has appeared in some of the most <lb/>arduous and
                    difficult of Shakespeare's characters <lb/>Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello,
                    Shylock, and <lb/>King John, investing each with its own peculiar <lb/>charms
                    and interest, and exciting the highest admira<lb break="no"/>tion and
                    astonishment at the versatility and power of <lb/>his genius, which could give
                    such individuality and <lb/>truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate
                    <lb/>classes of characters. The play with which his en<lb break="no"/>gagement
                    concluded was Richard, which character he has <lb/>performed <hi rend="italic"
                        >seven</hi> times during his engagement ; the house <lb/>was, as usual,
                    crowded in every part, and he exerted <lb/>himself most strenuously and
                    successfully. At the con<lb break="no"/>clusion the cheers of the audience were
                    loud and long, <lb/>and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage <lb/>from
                    different parts of the house. Mr K. being loud<lb break="no"/>ly called for,
                    appeared in front of the stage, and de<lb break="no"/>livered the following very
                    neat and appropriate ad<lb break="no"/>dress:&#x2013;"<hi rend="italic">Ladies
                        and Gentlemen,</hi>&#x2013;I now stand before <lb/>you for the last time
                    this season, but believe me <lb/>whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my
                    thoughts <lb/>will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to <lb/>its
                    distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when <lb/>he shall again stand upon
                    its threshold. (Great cheer<lb break="no"/>ing.) Till that period permit me with
                    a heavy, but a <lb/>grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word&#x2013;
                    <lb/>farewell." (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated <lb/>and enthusiastic
                    plaudits from all parts of the house.) <lb/>&#x2013;Mr K. we perceive, appears
                    next in Aberdeen, <lb/>where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his
                    <lb/>performances. The boxes there, we are told, are al<lb break="no"/>ready
                    taken for several successive nights to come.&#x2013; <lb/>Mrs Honey, from the
                    Theatre Royal, Haymarket, <lb/>makes her appearance here on Monday first.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, <lb/>baker, Castle Street, was
                    entertained at supper, in <lb/>Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a
                    <lb/>party of friends, of about fifty in number, previous to his <lb/>leaving
                    this country for America, to which he is about <lb/>to emigrate. The company was
                    very harmonious, and <lb/>the compliment must have been very gratifying to
                    <lb/>Mr Moxey.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Qualifications of General Assembly Elders.</hi>&#x2013;The
                    <lb/>Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. <lb/>elected the
                    Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter <lb/>Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to
                    represent them in the <lb/>ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Cap<lb
                        break="no"/>tain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in <lb/>the parish
                    of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an <lb/>elder there. Against his election
                    to serve in the As<lb break="no"/>sembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the
                    grounds, <lb/>as we understand, that he has no domicile within the <lb/>bounds
                    of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; <lb/>the protesters allowing
                    that his election, though con<lb break="no"/>sistent with the letter, is
                    contrary to the spirit of an <lb/>act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal
                    is <lb/>sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the <lb/>Assembly
                    elders must vacate their seats. Intimation <lb/>also was given by D. Maitland
                    M'Gill, Esq., that <lb/>when the commissions came to be attested, he would
                    <lb/>move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect <lb/>maintain family
                    worship. An amusing inquiry was <lb/>instituted in the Presbytery last year
                    respecting the <lb/>Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a
                    <lb/>clerical member had the candour to say, he should <lb/>wish to know how it
                    was with the ministers themselves <lb/>in that respect.</p>
                <p>The University of St Andrews has just conferred <lb/>the degree of Doctor of
                    Divinity on the Rev. Professor <lb/>Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this
                    public <lb/>honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has <lb/>done so
                    much for the cause of literature and religion, <lb/>the members of the College
                    have done an act which <lb/>shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which
                    <lb/>will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious pub<lb break="no"/>lic
                    of Scotland. Those who have had the good for<lb break="no"/>tune to enjoy the
                    public ministrations of Professor <lb/>Paxton, and even the general church-going
                        commu<lb break="no"/>nity, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence,
                    <lb/>of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical <lb/>elegance which
                    have long characterised his public <lb/>preaching. Even beyond the religious
                    body of which <lb/>he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the <lb/>most
                    popular and impressive teachers of the day. In <lb/>his lectures on Theology, as
                    Professor to the General <lb/>Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate
                    <lb/>Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and <lb/>profound critical
                    study of the Scriptures, and of an <lb/>unwearied research into the Natural
                    History, and the <lb/>manners and usages of the ancients nations. The <lb/>work
                    by which he is chiefly known as an author&#x2013; <lb/><hi rend="italic">The
                        Illustrations of Scripture</hi>&#x2013;will long bear testi<lb break="no"
                    />mony to the extent of his learning, and of his Orien<lb break="no"/>tal
                    investigations, and to his powers of lucid and elo<lb break="no"/>quent
                    composition. We understand that the attention <lb/>of the College was directed
                    to Mr Paxton's merits by <lb/>the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages.
                    <lb/>This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the <lb/>same field of
                    study, reflects high honour on the dis<lb break="no"/>crimination and the heart
                    of Mr Tennant.</p>

                    cloth having been removed and the usual loyal <lb/>toasts drank, the chairman,
                    in a neat and appropriate <lb/>speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to
                    <lb/>whom the present meeting had assembled to do ho<lb break="no"/>nour, and
                    who at once commanded their esteem as a <lb/>member of society and their
                    admiration as a man of <lb/>talent, which toast was drank with the greatest
                        en<lb break="no"/>thusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace <lb/>the
                    Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricul<lb break="no"/>tural Society of
                    Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh <lb/>Veterinary College, which was followed
                    by a variety <lb/>of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs <lb/>were
                    sung, and the conviviality of the evening was <lb/>kept up until a late
                    hour.</p>

                <p>Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferent<lb break="no"/>ly managed;
                    and we are glad to find that such a man <lb/>as Sir John Franklin is appointed
                    to govern Van Die<lb break="no"/>men's Land; and the sooner an improved system
                    is <lb/>adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only <lb/>are men sent out
                    to govern who are ignorant of human <lb/>nature, a knowledge of which is
                    essential to the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of the heterogenous materials of our
                    penal colo<lb break="no"/>nies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes
                    <lb/>to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our <lb/>rulers have the
                    sense to see the importance of sending <lb/>our respectable females to these
                    colonies ; but they trust <lb/>an Emigration Committee, and this committee
                    trusts <lb/>individuals who desire to make the most of the con<lb break="no"
                    />cern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of mak<lb break="no"/>ing the
                    public acquainted with the mode in which <lb/>the business is conducted, in the
                    hope that some hu<lb break="no"/>mane Member of Parliament will take the subject
                    <lb/>up. The mode of managing female emigration is <lb/>this :&#x2013;</p>
                <p>A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a <lb/>free passage to
                    Australia. A ship is hired, and this <lb/>ship must ave a <hi rend="italic"
                        >full</hi> cargo, to satisfy the <hi rend="italic">owners.</hi>
                    <lb/>Advertisements are issued, and instead of hard work<lb break="no"/>ing
                    females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dress<lb break="no"/> makers, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c., with a small mixture of better <lb/>articles, is made up. But if, as
                    almost always hap<lb break="no"/>pens, a sufficient number of these to fill the
                    ship <lb/>does not come forward, a supply of sweepings <lb/>is taken from a
                    workhouse! Here, then, is such a <lb/>mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to
                    the amount <lb/>of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough <lb/>of evil to
                    corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the <lb/>poor creatures they are crammed
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">four into one</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">bed</hi> !</p>
                <p>Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to <lb/>know the fact, that some
                    young women of respectabi<lb break="no"/>lity who wished to go to New South
                    Wales <hi rend="italic">with their</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="italic">friends</hi>, were refused a free passage, unless they
                    went <lb/>to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we <lb/>see that the
                    interests of agents and shipowners over<lb break="no"/>comes the interests of
                    the colonies, and actually ob<lb break="no"/>structs the attainment of the
                    object in view. We find <lb/>blindness a very common ailment in every department
                    <lb/>of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may <lb/>be to reform every
                    abuse, and to adopt useful mea<lb break="no"/>sures, they are often thwarted by
                    the necessity (which <lb/>ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and
                    leeches, <lb/>which devour the public substance, and suck the pub<lb break="no"
                    />lic blood. Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean <lb/>the outside of the
                    platter ; and it may not reach the <lb/>inside in our day. It is the duty,
                    however, of all pa<lb break="no"/>triots, to sharpen the knife that is to cut
                    out corruption <lb/>from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of ex<lb
                        break="no"/>posure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to
                    <lb/>support those who are willing to apply it.</p>
                <p>As in a matter of so much importance nothing <lb/>should be concealed, there is
                    no hesitation in stating <lb/>that it consists with our knowledge that, after
                    the <lb/>Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land, detail<lb break="no"/>ing
                    the deplorable consequences of sending out young <lb/>women from workhouses, a
                    ship has actually sailed, <lb/>nearly filled up as we have described. When any
                    <lb/>representation is made to a public office, the matter is <lb/>said to
                    belong to another department ; and that other <lb/>department says it is not its
                    province to interfere ; and <lb/>thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the
                        battle<lb break="no"/>dore of jobbing and the blindness of office.</p>
                <p>If our brethren of the press will take up this, the <lb/>inhuman job will be put
                    an end to.</p>

                    will <lb/>be graciously pleased to issue his royal orders that a placard

                    clergy and the parochial authorities <lb/>be withdrawn." He had been assured y
                    several gentlemen <lb/>who had returned from Van Diemen's land, that many of the
                    <lb/>young females sent out by the Emigration committee had <lb/>been
                    irrevocable consigned to prostitution, and that such as <lb/>obtained services
                    found themselves placed among a very dif<lb break="no"/>ferent calss of persons
                    to that which they had been accustom<lb break="no"/>ed to mix with in this
                    country. The hon. member read an <lb/>extract from a Hobart Town paper, of the
                    19th of February <lb/>last, in which it was stated that some of the females
                    "thus <lb/>launched into the world," were not more than twelve of thir<lb

                    the <lb/>mode of their meployment, were all to be found int he papers <lb/>on
                    the table of the house. In conclusion, he begged of the <lb/>hon. member and
                    others, when statements relative to emi<lb break="no"/>gration were made, to

                <p>The Wool Trade is very brisk. The arrivals this week have <lb/>been 2300 bales,

                    <lb/>Business in general is pretty good.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bradford, June</hi> 30.&#x2013;The activity we have so often
                    had to <lb/>report in the piece market continues unabated, and in six
                    <lb/>quarters, especially low and middle sorts, trade to-day is par<lb
                        break="no"/>ticularly brisk. Whatever alteration there may be in the

                    />ter. Stocks continue low in the staplers' hands, with very <lb/>little
                    disposition to increase them. Prices remain very steady, <lb/>although the
                    demand for wool is extremely limited. Farmers <lb/>are rather firmer. The
                    Liverpool sales of New South Wales <lb/>Wool went off 1d to 2d per lb. above the
                    recent London sales.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rochdale, June</hi> 27.&#x2013;The market this week was very
                    well <lb/>attended, but not so brisk as the last.&#x2013;Low goods were much
                    <lb/>in demand, and sold well. The trade in Rochdale is generally <lb/>good at
                    present, and building is going on to a very considerale <lb/>extent.</p>

                    brought <lb/>to this day's market, was not so large as that supplied last
                    <lb/>week, nor was the attendance of buyers so numerous, yet a <lb/>considerable
                    portion of business was done, and last week's <lb/>quotations were fully

                    entrance of Spencer's Gulf, on <lb/>the west side, or Nepean Bay, on the north
                    coast of <lb/>Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35, and <lb/>east
                    longitude 136, about 700 miles right west from <lb/>Sydney, the same distance
                    north-west from Van Die<lb break="no"/>men's Land, and about 1000 miles eastward
                    of the co<lb break="no"/>lony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about
                    <lb/>100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is <lb/>established under
                    Parliamentary Commissioners, as <lb/>an experiment, we believe, to try whether
                    it may not <lb/>be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration
                    <lb/>without any charge to the country, by selling lots of <lb/>land at such a
                    price as would defray the expense of <lb/>conveying the emigrants from England.
                    The plan <lb/>adopted is, to send out preferably young married per<lb break="no"
                    />sons under thirty, and to admit no slaves or convicts <lb/>into the colony. A
                    company has embarked t35,000 <lb/>in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent
                    out in <lb/>March to examine the coast carefully, that the <lb/>best site might
                    be chosen at first, and the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity of removal avoided. Six
                    vessels altogether <lb/>had sailed down to the 1st May, carrying out 152 male
                    <lb/>labourers with 37 females, and 26 male and 10 fe<lb break="no"/>males of a
                    superior class. These numbers include 26 <lb/>children. The Commissioners
                    attempted at first to <lb/>get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it
                        impos<lb break="no"/>sible, they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at
                    <lb/>this price 437 lots, consisting each of a country sec<lb break="no"/>tion
                    of 134 acres, and a town section of one acre, they <lb/>had raised the t35,000
                    required by the act of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment as the condition of the grant
                    of land. We give <lb/>these few details to put our readers in a condition to
                    <lb/>understand the notices which appear from time to <lb/>time in the papers
                    respecting the colony. We hope <lb/>the Commissioners or the adventurers will
                    give the <lb/>country a distinctive name. The title of "South <lb/>Australia" is
                    bad any way, and even positively ab<lb break="no"/>surd ; since Australia (<hi
                        rend="italic">quasi</hi> Australasia,) originally <lb/>intended for New
                    Holland, has already begun to be <lb/>monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The
                    district <lb/>at Spencer's Gulf, if it is to participated in the general
                    <lb/>denomination, should be termed "North" rather than <lb/>"South" Australia.
                    By the way, most of our colonies <lb/>in that quarter of the world have
                    ridiculous names, as <lb/>is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for
                    <lb/>the people out of them. What can be worse than a <lb/>"Van Diemen-lander ;"
                    a "New South-Wales-ian ;" <lb/>a "Swan River-ite ;" or a "King-George's Sound<lb
                        break="no"/>ian ! !"</p>

                <p><pb/>Thus the British Government is multiplying its <lb/>colonies round the
                    shores of New Holland. Exclusive <lb/>of Van Diemen's Land, which forms a
                    separate island, <lb/>we have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of
                    <lb/>Port Jackson ; a second recently formed at Port Philip, <lb/>500 miles
                    south from Sidney ; a third just described, at <lb/>St. Vincent's Gulf, 500
                    miles west from Port Philip ; <lb/>a fourth at King George's Sound, 1100 miles
                    west <lb/>from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at Swan River, 250 <lb/>miles north
                    from King George's South. All these <lb/>colonies are in the temperate zone,
                    between the lati<lb break="no"/>tudes of 30 and 38, and will have nearly the
                    <lb/>same climate. We had one at Melville Island, <lb/>on the north coast,
                    within the torried zone, in latitude <lb/>12 ; but it was found to be very
                    unhealthy, and was <lb/>abandoned, after a short trial, ten years ago.</p>
                <p>Though the interior of New Holland, so far as <lb/>hitherto explored, is one of
                    the most barren and un<lb break="no"/>promising lands in the world, there is a
                    margin of <lb/>good soil round the greater part of its coasts, capabale <lb/>[?]
                    of supporting twenty or thirty or fifty mil<lb break="no"/><cb/>
                    <lb/>lions of inhabitants; and there is little doubt that, in <lb/>the course of
                    three centuries, it will be the seat of a <lb/>great and powerful nation,
                    cultivating the arts, and <lb/>speaking the language of Britain, and
                    contributing <lb/>powerfully to spread civilisation over the Southern
                    <lb/>Hemisphere.</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration</hi>
                </p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Annual Report on Emigration just issued
                    <lb/>contains, besides the usual, correspondences and <lb/>documents connected
                    with the plan which has been <lb/>some time in operation, of transferring
                    labourers from <lb/>India to the Mauritius, and which it is now proposed <lb/>to
                    extend to New South Wales. Leaving this sub<lb break="no"/>jest for the present,
                    we shall state the general results[?] <lb/>of the emigration to Canada.</p>
                <p>The Report shows, that the whole number of <lb/>emigrants who landed at Quebec or
                    Montreal, in the <lb/>last nine years, was 259,788[?], averaging very nearly
                    <lb/>29,000 per annum. The years of greatest emigration <lb/>were 1831 and 1832,
                    the numbers for these years be<lb break="no"/>ing respectively 50,254 and
                    51,746. The proportions[?] [?] <lb/>furnished by the three kingdoms in the nine
                    years <lb/>were as follows :&#x2013;Among eight emigrants there were <lb/>five
                    Irishmen, two Englishmen, and one Scotsman. <lb/>Scotland in proportion to its
                    population has sent off <lb/>three times as many emigrants, and Ireland about
                    <lb/>nine times as may as England; and it should be <lb/>added, that a certain
                    part of the emigration from <lb/>England is artificial, consisting of paupers
                    sent out at <lb/>the expense of their parishes. Emigrations offers the <lb/>most
                    natural, practicable, and safe means of relieving a <lb/>country of its
                    redundant or unemployed population ; <lb/>and it may be asked, why it is so much
                    less resorted to <lb/>in England than in Scotland and Ireland? It cannot[?]
                    <lb/>be the ignorance of the English, for this would lead <lb/>to the inference
                    that the Irish, who emigrate in the <lb/>largest numbers, were the best informed
                    of the three <lb/>nations. It is, we apprehend, nothing but the Poor <lb/>Laws,
                    which hold out to the labourer the certainty of <lb/>a subsistence at home,
                    however idle or improvident he <lb/>may be, and render him averse to live in the
                        colo<lb break="no"/>nies, where he would have no such resource. This is
                    <lb/>only one of the many evils which these laws have pro<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>duced, not only to the country at large, but to the la<lb break="no"
                    />bouring classes themselves, whose average condition <lb/>was greatly
                    deteriorated, while only a fraction of their <lb/>number shared the benefit of
                    the allowance. We <lb/>speak of the Poor Laws as they existed before the Act
                    <lb/>of 1834 was passed.</p>
                <p>The number of emigrants who went to Canada <lb/>last year was 21,901, of whom
                    1399 went from <lb/>Scotland, 5580 from England, 14,538 from <lb/>Ireland, and
                    274 from Nova Scotia, Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, or the West Indies. In 1836
                    the number of <lb/>emigrants was 27,728. The ports in Scotland from <lb/>which
                    the greatest numbers sail are Greenock, Leith, <lb/>Aberdeen, and Cromarty. Of
                    the emigrants in 1837, <lb/>4000 settled in Lower Canada, 16,300 in Upper
                        Cana<lb break="no"/>da, 1500 went to the United States, and ninety-two
                    <lb/>died in the hospital or quarantine station.</p>
                <p>In the same period of nine years, 236,288[?] British <lb/>emigrants have landed
                    at new York, or fully 26,000 <lb/>per annum on average. There is a great
                    fluctua-[?] <lb/>tion in the number. In 1833 and 1835 it was only <lb/>16,000 ;
                    in 1837 it was 34,000 ; in 1836 no less than <lb/>59,075 ; and addingthe 27,728
                    who went to Canada, <lb/>no less than 86,800 persons must have landed at New
                    <lb/>York and Quebec from the British Isles in [?]. <lb/>There is a discrepancy,
                    however, between this account <lb/>and another in a different Return, also newly
                        pub<lb break="no"/>lished. The Report of the "Agent-General for Emi<lb
                        break="no"/>gration," makes the number who went to the United <lb/>States
                    from Britain in 1836, only 37,774. The for<lb break="no"/>mer probably
                    comprehends all British born subjects, <lb/>including persons from Nova Scotia,
                    Canada, and the <lb/>West Indies, and probably all passengers, many of <lb/>whom
                    returned.</p>
                <p>The Agent-General gives the number of persons <lb/>who emigrated to the British
                    Colonies and the United <lb/>States for every year since 1825. We present merely
                    <lb/>the average for the last year seven years.</p>
                <p>Annual number of Emigrants from Britain to <lb/>North American Colonies, 39[?],00
                    <lb/>Ditto do. to United States, 34,[?]00 <lb/>Ditto do. to Cape of Good Hope,
                    20[?] <lb/>Ditto do. to Australian Colonies, 3[?]0 <lb/>73[?],[?]</p>
                <p>In 1832, the number who emigrated to these Colo<lb break="no"/>nies was no less
                    than 103,140. The number who <lb/>went out to Australia in 1837, was much
                    greater than <lb/>in any preceding year, being 5054.</p>
                <p>If we assume that each emigrant pays for his pas<lb break="no"/>sage, &amp;c., or
                    has in his pocket t30, the average net[?] <lb/>expended on emigration will be
                    about two millions per <lb/>annum. It may be correctly stated now, that human
                    <lb/>beings form no inconsiderable <hi rend="italic">item</hi>, in number and
                    <lb/>value, of our exports. In the case of Ireland we sup<lb break="no"/>pose it
                    is by far the most flourishing, and by no means <lb/>the least advantageous
                    branch of the national com<lb break="no"/>merce.</p>
                <p>The annual increment of the population of <lb/>British Isles is about 330,000,
                    independently of the <lb/>efflux by emigration ; but including this, it must be
                    <lb/>about 420,000. It follows that there are about [?] <lb/>more inhabitants in
                    the country each day than there <lb/>were on the day before. Of the 1150
                    additional mortals[?] <lb/>emigration carries off 200.</p>
                <p>The establishment of steam navigation across the <lb/>Atlantic will, no doubt,
                    give a new impulse to the <lb/>circulation of human beings, while the
                    construction of <lb/>railroads across the Alleganies, and of canals in Canada,
                    <lb/>will greatly increase the capacity of the western world <lb/>to absorb the
                    imported multitudes. In seven years <lb/>hence, the journey from London to
                    Missouri will be <lb/>shorter in point of time, and perhaps cheaper, than the
                    <lb/>journey from Washington to Missouri was seven years <lb/>ago. A religious
                    man might see something like the <lb/>finger of Providence in the fact, that
                    just at the time <lb/>France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland,
                    <lb/>begin to feel severely the pressure of a redundant po<lb break="no"
                    />pulation, inventions have started into existence which <lb/>may be said to
                    annihilate space, and bring the most <lb/>thinly inhabited parts of the world,
                    into juxtaposition <lb/>with the most overpeopled.</p>
                <p>From the American Almanac, we find that the num<lb break="no"/>ber of passengers
                    who arrived in the United States in <lb/>1836, was 81,000, of whom 4000 were
                    native Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans. The proportion of emigrants from the different
                    <lb/>foreign countries was&#x2013;</p>
                <p>From the British Isles, 47,792 <lb/>... British American Colonies, 2,681 <lb/>...
                    Germany, 20,142 <lb/>... France, 4,443 <lb/>... Prussia, 563 <lb/>...
                    Switzerland, 465 <lb/>... Denmark, 414 <lb/>... Holland, 298 <lb/>... Mexico,
                    797 <lb/>... Texas, 698 <lb/>... Cuba, 516 <lb/>... Other countries, 2,152</p>
                <p>Some curious inferences might be drawn from this <lb/>table, as to the motives
                    which induce men to leave <lb/>their native country. <hi rend="italic">Celeris
                        paribus</hi>, there is most <lb/>emigration where there is most
                    intelligence. Thus, <lb/>Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, Naples, the Papal States,
                    <lb/>and Austria, furnish no emigrants to American, while <lb/>Britain and
                    Germany furnish a vast number. Much, <lb/>however, must depend on the domestic
                    condition of <lb/>the country, and on the greater or less facilities for
                    <lb/>removing. Thus, considering its inland position, and <lb/>the small number
                    of its inhabitants, the spirit of emi<lb break="no"/>gration must be much more
                    active in Switzerland, <lb/>which sends out 445 persons, than in France, which
                    <lb/>sends out 4443.</p>
                <p>The magistrates of New York, it appears, con<lb break="no"/>sider the influx of
                    emigrants a nuisance, and it <lb/>would seem, from an expression of Mr
                    Buchanan's, the <lb/>agent at Quebec, that they had laid a tax of ten dol<lb
                        break="no"/>lars upon all who arrive with an intention of settling. <lb/>The
                    key to this proceeding is no doubt to be found in <lb/>the following facts. A
                    Board of Aldermen reported in <lb/>June last, that the expense of City
                    Almshouses in the <lb/>preceding year were 205,500 dollars, or t44,000 ; that
                    <lb/>of 1209 persons admitted in a certain period, 932 were <lb/>aliens ; and
                    that the whole number under the charge <lb/>of the Commissioners was 3074, of
                    whom three-fourths <lb/>were foreigners. A communication from the Mayor <lb/>at
                    the same time says:&#x2013;" Nearly 2000 emigrants arrive <lb/>each week ; our
                    streets are filled with the wandering <lb/>crowds of those passengers,
                    clustering in our city, <lb/>unaccustomed to our climate, without money, without
                    <lb/>employment, without friends, many not speaking our <lb/>language, without
                    any dependence for food, or rainment[?], <lb/>or fireside." In Boston and
                    Philadelphia, also, nearly <lb/>one-half of the inmates of the almshouses were
                        foreign<lb break="no"/>ers.</p>

                <p>On Wednesday, the Commission of Assembly met in <lb/>the Tolbooth
                    Church&#x2013;Dr Muir, Moderator, in the <lb/>chair.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales.</hi>
                    <lb/>&#x2013;The Moderator recalled to the notice of the Commis<lb break="no"
                    />sion, that on a former meeting, they had directed him <lb/>to write to Lord
                    Glenelg, Secretary for the Colonies, <lb/>disavowing connection with Dr Lang in
                    New South <lb/>Wales, and blaming his proceedings in that colony, in
                    <lb/>separating himself from the Presbytery there formed in <lb/>connection with
                    the Church of Scotland. Since that <lb/>time he had had a communication from
                    Lord Glenelg, <lb/>which he was sure would be received by the Commis<lb
                        break="no"/>sion with great satisfaction.</p>
                <p>The communication from Lord Glenelg was then <lb/>read. It consisted of a copy of
                    the despatch transmit<lb break="no"/>ted to the Governor of New South Wales,
                    approving <lb/>of his conduct in withholding the salaries of the Pres<lb
                        break="no"/>byterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to <lb/>the
                    authority of the Presbytery in connection with the <lb/>Church of Scotland, and
                    further directing that Dr <lb/>Lang's salary should be discontinued. His
                    lordship <lb/>explained, that in doing this the Government had no <lb/>wish to
                    constitute themselves judges in any ecclesias<lb break="no"/>tical disputes ;
                    but as the salaries awarded to these <lb/>gentlemen had been given on the faith
                    that they were <lb/>to remain in connection with the Church of Scotland,
                    <lb/>they could not be continued so long as they defied her <lb/>authority.</p>
                <p>On the motion of Mr Dunlop, the Commission una<lb break="no"/>nimously expressed
                    their satisfaction with the prompti<lb break="no"/>tude and decision which the
                    Government had shown <lb/>in the matter ; and directed the Moderator to commu<lb
                        break="no"/>nicate their minute to Lord Glenelg. It was also agreed <lb/>to
                    re-appoint the Committee to watch over the farther <lb/>proceedings, especially
                    as it was understoof that Dr <lb/>Lang was now on his way to this country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case of Small Isles.</hi>&#x2013;The Commission, then pro<lb
                        break="no"/>ceeded to take up the case of Small Isles, which, it will
                    <lb/>be recollected, arose out of the Rev. Mr M'Lean hav<lb break="no"/>ing, as
                    was alleged, appeared in the lobby of the As<lb break="no"/>sembly House, while
                    that Court was sitting in May last, <lb/>in a state of intoxication. The case
                    occupied the Court <lb/>a considerable part of the day; and at the evening
                    <lb/>sederunt the following motion, by Dr Gardner, was una<lb break="no"
                    />nimously agreed to&#x2013;That the Commission having con<lb break="no"
                    />sidered the evidence on the record, find, that in as far <lb/>as that evidence
                    is hearsay, it is inadmissable; but find <lb/>it proved that on the afternoon of
                    Friday the 25th of <lb/>May last, Mr M'Lean was seen in a state of intoxication
                    <lb/>in the vestibule of the General Assembly, attempting <lb/>to force his way
                    into it; that it is proved he was on two <lb/>other occasions during the sitting
                    of last Assembly in a <lb/>state of intoxication; and, therefore, they find that

                    deposition, directing the Clerk to trans<lb break="no"/>mit an extract of the
                    sentence to the Presbytery of <lb/>Skye, and them to declare the parish of Small
                    Isles <lb/>vacant.&#x2013;The Moderator pronounced from the chair <lb/>the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Case of Lethendy.</hi>&#x2013;In the course of the
                        proceed<lb break="no"/>ings during the early sederunt of the Commission, the
                    <lb/>Procurator rose and said, he might take the present <lb/>opportunity of
                    stating to the Commission, that within <lb/>the last three or four days a
                    petition and complaint had <lb/>been given in to the Court of Session, and
                    appointed to <lb/>be served, at the instance of Mr Clark, presentee to the
                    <lb/>parish of Lethendy, against the Presbytery of Dunkeld, <lb/>and Mr Kessen,
                    whom that Presbytery had lately in<lb break="no"/>ducted into that charge, in
                    despite of interdicts issued <lb/>by the Court of Session. He mentioned the fact
                    to that <lb/>Commission, presuming that they would authorize him <lb/>to defend
                    the Presbytery, who had acted under autho<lb break="no"/>rity of the Commission
                    itself.</p>
                <p>Mr Buchanan of Glasgow, after some remarks in <lb/>commendation of the firmness
                    of the Presbytery in carry<lb break="no"/>ing through the settlement amidst many
                    difficulties, <lb/>moved that "The Commission sanction the Procu<lb break="no"
                    />rator's defending the Presbytery in the trying <lb/>circumstances in which
                    they are placed, and resolve <lb/>that they will to the utmost of their power
                    encourage <lb/>and support them under whatsoever difficulties they <lb/>may be
                    subjected by their execution of the sentence <lb/>of the Commission ; and that
                    the thanks of the Com<lb break="no"/>mission be given to the Presbytery for the
                    decision and <lb/>temperate firmness with which they have practically
                    <lb/>maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of <lb/>the Church."</p>
                <p>Dr Bryce said, he was quite unprepared for any mo<lb break="no"/>tion on this
                    subject; but with the views which he enter<lb break="no"/>tained in regard to
                    this case, it was impossible he could <lb/>concur in the motion proposed, and he
                    must therefore <lb/>dissent from it.</p>
                <p>Mr James Bridges expressed great indignation against <lb/>Mr Clark for thus
                    bidding defiance to the authority of <lb/>the Church Courts, and he proposed,
                    that for thus <lb/>trampling on the rights and dignity of the Church, Mr
                    <lb/>Clark should be forthwith called before the Commission <lb/>for an
                    exemplary punishment.&#x2013;Mr Dunlop suggested, <lb/>that although he
                    concurred in feeling with Mr Bridges, <lb/>it would be premature at present to
                    take any steps <lb/>against Mr Clark, inasmuch as there was no official
                    <lb/>communication on the subject from the Presbytery of <lb/>Dunkeld.</p>
                <p>Mr Makgill recommended to Mr Bridges, for this <lb/>reason, not to press his
                    motion, declaring, that as at <lb/>this time 200 years ago eight Bishops had
                    been de<lb break="no"/>posed, he trusted the time was not far distant when Mr
                    <lb/>Clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct; <lb/>and Mr M.
                    said emphatically, that whatever the Pres<lb break="no"/>bytery of Dunkeld might
                    suffer for upholding the inde<lb break="no"/>pendence of the Church, he, as a
                    member of Commis<lb break="no"/>sion, by whose orders they had acted, would be
                    proud to <lb/>bear his share.</p>
                <p>Mr bridges then intimated, that he would waive <lb/>pressing his motion, and Mr
                    Buchanan's was adopted, <lb/>Dr Bryce and Mr W. Malcolm intimating their
                    dissent, <lb/>on the ground that it was incompetent and inexpedient <lb/>for the
                    Commission to adopt such a resolution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Commemoration of the Second Centenary of the</hi>
                    <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Celebrated Assembly at Glasgow.</hi>&#x2013;In the
                    course <lb/>of the day, the Moderator suggested, that as this was <lb/>the
                    second centenary of the great Assembly at Glas<lb break="no"/>gow, which might
                    be considered as the founder, not <lb/>only of their ecclesiastical but of their
                    civil liverties, <lb/>a meeting should be held, exclusively devoted to prayer
                    <lb/>and thanksgiving to Almighty God for the benefits con<lb break="no"/>ferred
                    on their Zion.</p>
                <p>At seven o'clock accordingly, several of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and a
                    considerable number of people assembled, <lb/>when an hour was spent in
                    devotional exercises, which <lb/>were conducted by Drs Muir, Lee, and Dickson,
                    in <lb/>succession.</p>
                <p>The Commission adjourned to the second Tuesday in <lb/>February next.</p>

                    misery, and proved fully, <lb/>at least to our satisfaction, that a powerful and
                        effi<lb break="no"/>cacious remedy was applicable in the objects of the
                    <lb/>meeting. The subject seemed to tell powerfully on <lb/>the meeting ; the
                    speakers were heard with great at<lb break="no"/>tention, and the applauses they
                    received told that the <lb/>public feeling was deeply identified with the future

                    <lb/>For the Father of beauty in love hath smiled <lb/>On the sweet green bowers
                    of the woodland wild <lb/>The woodlan wild !&#x2013;long, long ago, <lb/>I have

                    where the wondrous monk of old, <lb/>His hermitage reared in the pleasant wold;
                    <lb/>By its door a crystal springlet boiled, <lb/>For the pilgrim to drink, in
                    the woodlan wild! <lb/>The woodland wild !&#x2013;what pleasant stories
                    <lb/>Make sunlight over its olden glories,&#x2013; <lb/>Of Robin Hood and his

                    in spring, and in summer time, <lb/>The glorious forests are aye in prime ;
                    <lb/>For glad thoughts forever are round them piled, <lb/>Those grassy glades in
                    the woodland wild! <lb/>The woodland wild!&#x2013;make haste.&#x2013;make haste!
                    <lb/>Away with me, and its gladness taste; <lb/>We will wander beside each
                    gushing stream, <lb/>Where flowers in the water reflected gleam; <lb/>We will
                    follow its paths and pluck its flowers, <lb/>And lie on its grass in the evening
                    hours, <lb/>Till the dying sunlight, soft and mild, <lb/>Warns us away from the

                    <lb/>time ago a vessel was advertised to sail from this port <lb/>for Australia,
                    and to take out Government settlers free <lb/>of expense. A family in Shetland,
                    consisting of the <lb/>husband, wife, and six of a young family, sold off their
                    <lb/>effects and came to Leith for the purpose of availing <lb/>themselves of
                    this opportunity to settle in the above <lb/>colony. On applying to the agent,
                    however, they were <lb/>informed that they did not come under the description
                    <lb/>of persons wanted. Since, therefore, they have <lb/>lived in Leith till
                    their little all has been exhausted, <lb/>and the husband, from the combined
                    effects of disap<lb break="no"/>pointment and want, has been thrown upon a
                    sick-bed, <lb/>and the whole family are literally in a state of starvation.
                    <lb/>Several private individuals, with a benevolence that <lb/>does them the
                    highest credit, have temporarily sup<lb break="no"/>plied their wants ; but the
                    hands of private charity is <lb/>soon crippled, and unless something else be
                        immedi<lb break="no"/>ately done, we may have soon to report one or more of
                    <lb/>their deaths from the actual want of the necessaries of <lb/>life. The
                    object of the present notice therefore is to <lb/>draw forth the sympathies of
                    the charitable, to relive a <lb/>family thus suddenly involved in want and
                    misery, who, <lb/>from their industrious habits and every way excellent
                    <lb/>characters, left their native home with the good wishes <lb/>of all their
                    friends. Any donations, either in money <lb/>or clothes, will be thankfully

                    <lb/>was held in the Guildhall of the city of London, pur<lb break="no"/>suant
                    to a requisition to the Lord Mayor, for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of
                    petitioning her Majesty and both Houses of <lb/>Parliament " to adopt prompt and
                    efficient measures <lb/>for preserving from invasion or abandonment the long<lb

                    of New Zealand, at present endangered by <lb/>foreign pretensions, and by the
                    acts of the Executive Go<lb break="no"/>vernment ; also for stopping the course
                    of lawless emi<lb break="no"/>gration and settlement, which has not only proved
                    <lb/>deeply injurious to the native people of the country, <lb/>but threatens
                    their speedy extermination ; and, lastly, <lb/>for establishing the most

                    restraints of British <lb/>law, under a distinct colonial government, in place
                    of <lb/>the state of anarchy which now prevails among both <lb/>races, and all
                    other classes of her Majesty's subjects, and <lb/>others inhabiting or resorting
                    to New Zealand, as a <lb/>distant independency of the territory of New South
                    <lb/>Wales." Including the gentlemen of the hustings, <lb/>the entire number
                    might be calculated at 400 indivi<lb break="no"/>duals. The Lord Mayor took the
                    chair. Resolu<lb break="no"/>tions in accordance with the object of the meeting
                    <lb/>were moved and seconded by Mr G. Palmer, M.P., <lb/>Mr F. Baring, M.P., Mr

                    <lb/>?It will gratify the admirers of the Duke of Welling<lb break="no"/>ton to
                    learn, that the Directors of the New Zealand <lb/>Company have resolved that the
                    name of the city <lb/>founded by Colonel Wakefield, Lambton Harbour, <lb/>Port
                    Nicholson, and which is destined to become the <lb/>capital of New Zealand,
                    shall be named "The City <lb/>of Wellington," in honour of the illustrious Duke.
                    <lb/>The Duke is a great advocate for colonization, and to <lb/>him the
                    promoters of colonization of South Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia were in a great
                    measure indebted for securing <lb/>the enactment of the statute which gave
                    effect to the <lb/>principles on which that colony is founded ; and, as many
                    <lb/>of the promoters of South Australian emigration are Di<lb break="no"
                    />rectors of the New Zealand Company, they have re<lb break="no"/>solved,
                    setting all party politics aside, to confer this ho<lb break="no"/>nour on the
                    Duke. There could be no stronger proof of <lb/>the political sagacity and
                    statesmanlike views of the <lb/>Duke, than his approval of the Wakefield system
                    <lb/>of colonization, and no better mode of perpetuating <lb/>his name than by
                    bestowing it on the metropolis of the <lb/>"Great Britain of the Southern
                    Hemisphere."</p>

                <p>Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round <lb/>The Globe &amp;c. &amp;c By Frederick
                    Debell <lb/>Bennett, Esq., F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: <lb/>Richard Bentley.</p>
                <p>We have been somewhat disappointed in these <lb/>volumes. We expected to have
                    found them, like <lb/>Scoresby's, full of interesting details regarding
                    <lb/>whale fishing, whereas, there is hardly a word on <lb/>the subject
                    throughout the whole of the first vo<lb break="no"/>lume, and very little in the
                    second ; in fact, what <lb/>there is, is confined to a sort of supplementary
                        ap<lb break="no"/>pendix. This is the more strange, that one of the
                    <lb/>chief purposes of the author, as he himself informs <lb/>us, in undertaking
                    this voyage, was to investigate <lb/>the anatomy and habits of southern whales,
                    and <lb/>the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery, <lb/>subjects which, he
                    remarks, were then untouched <lb/>by the literature of any country. Yet, in the
                    <lb/>work itself, this chief purpose dwindles into one <lb/>of very secondary
                    prominence. This, the readers <lb/>of the work, at least most of them, will the
                    more <lb/>regret, on finding how very curious and interest<lb break="no"/>ing
                    are the two or three chapters which the author <lb/>has given on the subejct of
                    South Sea whaling. <lb/>There are full of entertaining details of both a
                    <lb/>popular and scientific character, and cannot be <lb/>read without exciting
                    a wish that larger portion <lb/>of the work had been composed of such
                    material.</p>
                <p>In making these remarks, however, we are far <lb/>from intending to depreciate
                    the sort of informa<lb break="no"/>tion, in the shape chiefly of sketches of the
                    South <lb/>Sea Islands, to which the greater part of the vo<lb break="no"/>lumes
                    are devoted ; we mean merely to say, that <lb/>it is not what we expected from
                    the title of the <lb/>work, nor, we may add, what, for our own reading, <lb/>we
                    should have preferred. Yet are these sketches <lb/>very amusing
                    reading&#x2013;full of graphic descriptions <lb/>and curious details of native
                    character, which is <lb/>still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of
                    <lb/>very primitive simplicity. "We have frequently <lb/>seen," says Mr Bennett,
                    " amongst the congrega<lb break="no"/>gation assembled at Church (in Raiatea), a
                    native <lb/>clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a <lb/>beaver hat
                    surmounting a person naked except <lb/>the scanty maro ; and a third, whose
                    whole attire <lb/>was a black coat, white neckerchief, and a shirt!"</p>
                <p>We observe a rather odd circumstance noted <lb/>by Mr Bennett. He says that the "
                    temperate <lb/>ships" of America are the principal purveyors of <lb/>ardent
                    spirits to the natives of the South Sea <lb/>Islands, carrying large quantities
                    of rum thither <lb/>for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the
                    <lb/>temperance principle in a somewhat curious pre<lb break="no"/>dicament.</p>
                <p>Another remark of the author's not less strik<lb break="no"/>ing&#x2013;mark it
                    well and take comfort from it ye <lb/><hi rend="italic">bon vivants[?]</hi> of
                    the civilzed world&#x2013;is, that disease <lb/>is as abundant amongst the
                    native islanders as <lb/>amongst the most refined of their species, and from
                    <lb/>this concludes, that man in his savage state is as <lb/>liable to the "
                    ills that flesh is heir to," as in his <lb/>civilised condition. Dr Johnson made
                    a similar <lb/>remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; <lb/>alleging that
                    the London alderman lived as long <lb/>over his turtle feast, as the Highlander
                    over his <lb/>paten cake. What degree of fellow-feeling with <lb/>civic
                    dignitary and his good living, or whether <lb/>any, dictated this remark of the
                    learned doctor, <lb/>we cannot say.</p>
                <p>Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability, <lb/>and in style whose only
                    fault is exhibited in a <lb/>tendency, occasionally, to the use of rather
                    learned <lb/>phraseology.</p>
                <p>We conclude with an extract from that portion <lb/>of the work which, from its
                    great interest, we <lb/>regretted was not larger, but which, limited <lb/>as it
                    is, is so full of curious information, and so <lb/>crowded with remarkable
                    incident, as to render <lb/>the selection by no means an easy task.</p>
                <p>"Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ <lb/>their tail when attacked, but
                    prove active and danger<lb break="no"/>ous with their jaws. Such individuals
                    often rather seek <lb/>than avoid the attacking boats, and, rushing upon them
                    <lb/>with open mouth, employ every possible art to crush <lb/>them with their
                    teeth, and, if successful, will sometimes <lb/>continue in their neighbourhood,
                    biting the wreck and <lb/>oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a
                    <lb/>boat, the whale usually turns and swings upon its back, <lb/>and will
                    sometimes act in a very sluggish and unac<lb break="no"/>countable manner,
                    keeping its formidable lower jaw <lb/>suspended for some moments over the boat,
                    in a threat<lb break="no"/>ening attitude, but ultimately rolling to one side,
                    and <lb/>closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe <lb/>this
                    whale, when pursued and attacked, retain[?] its mouth <lb/>in an expanded state
                    for some minutes together. Such <lb/>threatening demonstrations of the jaw, as
                    well as some <lb/>others with the flukes, occasionally compel a boat's <lb/>crew
                    to leap into the water, and support themselves <lb/>by swimming or clinging to
                    oars until the danger has <lb/>passed.</p>
                <p>"In the year 1835, the ship Pusie Hall encountered <lb/>a fighting whale, which
                    after injuring and driving off <lb/>her four boats, pursued them to the ship,
                    and withstood <lb/>for some time the lances hurled at it, by the crew, from
                    <lb/>the bows of the vessel, before in could be induced to <lb/>retire ; in this
                    affair a youth in one of the boats was <lb/>destroyed by a blow from the whale,
                    and one of the <lb/>officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact
                    <lb/>with the animal's jaw.</p>
                <p>"A highly tragical instances of the power and fero<lb break="no"/>city
                    occasionally displayed by the sperm whale, is re<lb break="no"/>corded in the
                    fate of the American South-Seaman <lb/>Essex, Captain G. Pollard. This vessel,
                    when cruis<lb break="no"/>ing in the Pacific Ocean, in the year 1820, was
                    wrecked <lb/>by a whale under the following extraordinary circum<lb break="no"
                    />stances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a <lb/>school of whales, and
                    the ship was attending them to <lb/>windward. The master and second mate were
                    engaged <lb/>with whales they had harpooned, in the midst of the <lb/>school,
                    and the chief mate had returned on board to <lb/>equip a spare boat, in lieu of
                    his own, which had been <lb/>broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew
                    <lb/>were thus occupied, the look-out at the masthead re<lb break="no"/>ported
                    that a large whale was coming rapidly down <lb/>upon the ship, the mate hastened
                    his task, in the <lb/>hope that he might be ready in time to attack it.</p>
                <p>"The Cachalot, which was of the largest size, con<lb break="no"/>sequently a
                    male, and probably the guardian of the <lb/>school, in the meanwhile approached
                    the ship so closely, <lb/>that the although the helm was put up to avoid the
                        con<lb break="no"/>tact, he struck her a severe blow, which broke off a
                    <lb/>portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then ob<lb break="no"/>served
                    to retire to some distance, and again rush upon <lb/>the ship with extreme
                    velocity. His enormous head <lb/>struck the starboard bow, beating in a
                    corresponding <lb/>portion of the planks, and the people on board had
                    <lb/>barely time to take to their boats, before the ship filled <lb/>with water
                    and fell over on her side. She did not sink, <lb/>however, for some hours ; and
                    the crew in the boats <lb/>continued near the wreck until they had obtained a
                    <lb/>small supply of provisions, when they shaped a course <lb/>for land ; but
                    here, it is to be regretted, they made a <lb/>fatal error. At the time the
                    accident happened they <lb/>were cruising on the Equator, in the longitude of
                    about <lb/>118[?] degrees West, with the Marquesan and Society <lb/>Islands on
                    their lee, and might have sailed in their <lb/>boats to either of those groups
                    in a comparatively short <lb/>time. Under an erroneous impression, however, that
                    <lb/>all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race <lb/>of people, they
                    preferred pulling to windward for the <lb/>coast of Peru, and in the attempt
                    were exposed for a <lb/>lengthened period in extreme privations."</p>
                <p>A few Cachalots have been noted individually as <lb/>animals dangerous to attack.
                    One was thus distin<lb break="no"/>guished on the cruising ground off the coast
                    of New <lb/>Zealand, and was long know to whalers by the name <lb/>of 'New
                    Zealand Tom.' He is said to have been of <lb/>great size, conspicuously
                    distinguished by a white <lb/>hump ; and famous for the havoc he had made
                    amongst <lb/>the boats and gear of ships attempting his destruction. <lb/>A
                    second example, of cimilar celebrity, was known to <lb/>whalers in the Straits
                    of Timor. He had so often <lb/>succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as
                    to be <lb/>considered invincible, but was at length despatched by <lb/>a whaler,
                    who, forewarned of his combative temper, <lb/>adopted the expedient of floating
                    a cask on the sea, to <lb/>withdraw his attention from the boats ; but
                        notwith<lb break="no"/>standing this <hi rend="italic">ruse</hi> the animal
                    was not destroyed with<lb break="no"/>out much hard fighting, nor until the bow
                    of one of <lb/>the boats had been nipped off by his jaws."</p>

                <p>On Monday night a public meeting, chiefly com<lb break="no"/>posed of the working
                    classes, was held in the Justi<lb break="no"/>ciary Court Hall, Glasgow, for the
                    purpose of memo<lb break="no"/>rializing Lord John Russell in favour of
                    obtaining <lb/>the Lord Provost in the chair. The hall was crowded <lb/>to
                    excess, and it was perfectly evident from the first that <lb/>the Chartists had
                    mustered in great strength to carry <lb/>out their usual course of obstruction
                    to the particular <lb/>business of the evening.&#x2013;Mr T. Gillespie proposed
                    a <lb/>resolution in favour of emigration to New Zealand <lb/>through the medium
                    of funds raised by the sale of <lb/>lands in the colony, and addressed the
                    meeting at <lb/>some length in support of the resolution.&#x2013;Mr R. Malcolm,
                    jun. <lb/>a young lad, and a Chartist spouter, after a long <lb/>speech,
                    proposed an amendment; to the effect that <lb/>while the meeting was favourable
                    to emigration to New <lb/>Zealand, or any other part of the world, by those so
                    <lb/>disposed, they objected to any application being <lb/>made for a grant of
                    public money for any such pur<lb break="no"/>pose&#x2013;that they were opposed
                    to the question of emi<lb break="no"/>gration being allowed to occupy public
                    attention, &amp;c. <lb/>and concluded with the statement that emigration
                    <lb/>would not afford even temporary relief to the oppressed <lb/>operatives,
                    and that bad laws were the chief cause of <lb/>all their present sufferings,
                    &amp;c. This amendment <lb/>which was supported by the most trifling arguments
                    <lb/>we ever heard brought forward in public, was of <lb/>course loudly cheered
                    by the Chartists. The Lord <lb/>Provost repeatedly explained that he had agreed
                    to <lb/>take the chair on the understanding that the subject <lb/>of emigration
                    to New Zealand was to occupy the atten<lb break="no"/>tion ; but here a matter,
                    perfectly foreign to the busi<lb break="no"/>ness for which they were convened,
                    was introduced by <lb/>way of amendment ; there was an attack made upon <lb/>the
                    general policy of the country&#x2013;and he had posi<lb break="no"/>tively to
                    state that, if such an amendment was carried, <lb/>he would not remain in the
                    chair. This was received <lb/>by cries for "a new chairman" and much confusion,
                    <lb/>one party cheering, and the other hissing and yelling <lb/>alternately
                    during the greater part of the evening. A <lb/>discussion followed, in which a
                    boy named Jack took <lb/>a prominent part ; and it became perfectly evident that
                    <lb/>the Chartist speakers were woefully ignorant of the <lb/>subject they had
                    the impudence to discuss. It was <lb/>gravely and indignantly averred, that by
                    going to New <lb/>Zealand, the working men would incur the risk of <lb/>being
                    swallowed by cannibals! Till informed of the <lb/>contrary, the Chartists seemed
                    to think that the means <lb/>of emigration were to be supplied from the public
                        ex<lb break="no"/>chequer ; and when told that the funds were to be
                    <lb/>raised by the sale of lands in New Zealand, one of <lb/>them sagely
                    observed that it would be much more <lb/>humane and just to appropriate the
                    proceeds of those <lb/>sales of land to employ it in sending out emigrants !
                    <lb/>Another favourite argument was, that every person <lb/>had a right to
                    subsist in the land that gave him <lb/>birth, and that it was barbarous and
                    cruel to send <lb/>a man, however wretched, out of his native <lb/>country ;
                    also, that emigration would produce no <lb/>benefit to society at home, as the
                    places of those <lb/>sent off would soon be filled by others. Of <lb/>course, if
                    these arguments had always been held <lb/>good, and acted upon, the whole human
                    family would, <lb/>to this day, have been crowded together in the cradle <lb/>of
                    our race in the East, provided only the thing had <lb/>been possible; the
                    extension of mankind to other parts <lb/>of the world must have been wicked, and
                    cruel, and <lb/>useless&#x2013;for "for every inhabitant of a country is
                    entitled <lb/>to a subsistence in the land that gave him birth," and, <lb/>on
                    his removal to another land, his place would just be <lb/>filled by others ! The
                    above is a mere specimen of <lb/>the worse than childish arguments used by the
                    Chartist <lb/>spouters, and which the men who are now " knocking <lb/>loudly at
                    the door of the constitution for admission," <lb/>cheered as if they had been
                    fraught with the choicest <lb/>wisdom !&#x2013;Mr John Crawford, Secretary to
                    the New <lb/>Zealand Land Company, endeavoured, by some sensible <lb/>remarks,
                    to place the question of emigration to New <lb/>Zealand on its proper footing ;
                    but in vain ; they were <lb/>determined to have the charter only&#x2013;and till
                    then <lb/>starving workmen, willing, but unable, to emigrate, <lb/>must starve
                    on. On a division, the amendment pro<lb break="no"/>posed by Mr Malcolm was
                    carried by a large majority, <lb/>and, after a vote of thanks had been given to
                    the Lord <lb/>Provost, the meeting broke up. This was not done, <lb/>however,
                    till the Chartists were called upon to be at <lb/>their posts at the meeting to
                    be held to-day to address <lb/>the Queen&#x2013;to render themselves, of course,
                    a little <lb/>more odious by another stretch of their obstructive
                    <lb/>power&#x2013;if they can.</p>

                <p><pb/>On Monday a discussion of some interest took <lb/>place in the House of
                    Commons relative to the <lb/>affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain de<lb
                        break="no"/>fects in its government, that colony has fallen <lb/>into a
                    state of financial embarassment requiring <lb/>immediate relief. Lord John
                    Russell traced the <lb/>history of the settlement from its foundation, and
                    <lb/>stated that, while its revenue does not exceed <lb/>t20,000 its expenditure
                    has increased to the <lb/>enormous sum of t130,000 a year ! At present <lb/>its
                    affairs are managed by commissioners, the re<lb break="no"/>sponsible Ministers
                    of the Crown having no di<lb break="no"/>rect control over its expenditure. This
                    is mani<lb break="no"/>festly an evil, and must form the subject of future
                    <lb/>legislation, but in the meantime it is necessary to <lb/>provide for the
                    payment of certain bills now <lb/>over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell
                        pro<lb break="no"/>posed that her Majesty should be authorized to
                    <lb/>guarantee a loan of t210,000 for this purpose. <lb/>Lord Stanley concurred
                    generally in the views of <lb/>the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but though
                    <lb/>that the Government ought not to demand a <lb/>loan until they had brought
                    in a bill to explain <lb/>distinctly the principles on which they proposed
                    <lb/>that the colony should henceforth be governed. <lb/>Sir Robert Peel
                    suggested that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should ask a vote of credit for
                    the sum re<lb break="no"/>quired, which, as it met the urgency of the case,
                    <lb/>was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was <lb/>deferred till Friday.

                    <lb/>demnation of the application of a part of the Land and Emi<lb break="no"
                    />gration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of <lb/>gaols and police in
                    that colony. It was in 1831 that this ex<lb break="no"/>pense, antecedently
                    borne by the Home Government, was <lb/>for the first time thrown upon the
                    colony, whose revenues <lb/>were then found to yield considerable surplus of
                    revenue <lb/>beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was
                    <lb/>calculated to be about t25,000 a year ; and had that been all <lb/>the
                    colony would have borne it without a murmur; but in <lb/>fact it had ever since
                    averaged nearly t60,000. It was not <lb/>reasonable to impose such a charge on
                    the colony, on account <lb/>of gaols and police, constituted not the ordinary
                    uses of <lb/>a colonial society, but for the peculiar purposes of our trans<lb
                        break="no"/>portation system. The argument urged by the Home Govern<lb
                        break="no"/>ment was, that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive
                    <lb/>distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony, <lb/>whose
                    settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so <lb/>assigned. But that
                    assignment was a gain, not more to the <lb/>colonists, who obtained the labour,
                    than to the mother country, <lb/>which saved the expense of maintaing the
                    labourers. What<lb break="no"/>ever value the mother country might be entitled
                    to claim <lb/>for the labour of the convicts, ought in strictness to fall, not
                    <lb/>on the colony at large, but on the individual employers; and <lb/>if there
                    were valid reasons against an exaction of premium <lb/>from them, still it was
                    unjust to throw the obligation upon <lb/>the colony at large. That was to pay
                    private wages out of <lb/>public rates. This one charge on the oclony was
                    sufficient <lb/>on account for all that embarassment in its finances which
                    <lb/>had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled <lb/>to defray
                    the impact, only by resorting to the emigra<lb break="no"/>tion fund, and thus
                    checking emigration itself. No <lb/>less than t260,000 had been abstracted from
                    that fund to <lb/>meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that
                    <lb/>fund from emigration was a great evil, both to the colony, <lb/>where
                    labour is so pressingly needed, and to the poor of this <lb/>country, to whom
                    that refuge is so material. He considered <lb/>the emigration fund as held by
                    the Government in trust for <lb/>the united intersts of the colony and of the
                    mother country. <lb/>The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been
                    <lb/>[?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed<lb break="no"
                    />[?] would be applied to emigration.</p>
                <p>The hon. member was proceeding to cite the opinions of <lb/>various persons in
                    favour of this strict application, when a mo<lb break="no"/>tion was made to
                    count the House, and it adjourned for want <lb/>of its quorum[?] of 40 members.

                </p>
                <p>We have received a copy of a Series of Resolu<lb break="no"/>tions passed, on the
                    23d of October 1840, by the <lb/>Legislative Cuncil of New South Wales, on the
                    <lb/>subject of immigration into colony. The <lb/>object of these resolutions is
                    to encourage emigra<lb break="no"/>tion from the mother country, by showing the
                    <lb/>demand for labour in New South Wales, and the <lb/>advantages offered to
                    the immigrant. We have <lb/>only room for a few of the more important resolu<lb
                        break="no"/>tions :?</p>
                <p>Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony <lb/>an urgent and increasing
                    want of working hands, in <lb/>every branch of industry ; that there is ample
                        employ<lb break="no"/>ment for emigrants, at highly renumerating wages
                    <lb/>without the interruption, in this mild climate, experi<lb break="no"/>enced
                    in colder countries during the winter months ; <lb/>and that, even during the
                    worst period of the past <lb/>severe drought, no persons able and willing to
                    work <lb/>found any difficult in procuring advantageous employ<lb break="no"
                    />ment.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That, in the opinion of this Council, there <lb/>can be no more
                    advantageous field for the employment <lb/>of industry than is presented in New
                    South Wales&#x2013; <lb/>experience proving, that able-bodied, sober, indus<lb
                        break="no"/>trious and careful emigrants may, within a few years <lb/>after
                    their arrival, rise form the condition of labourers <lb/>to be themselves
                    employers of labour; by which pro<lb break="no"/>cess, and by the progressive
                    increase of the flocks and <lb/>herds of the colony, a constant demand for
                    additional <lb/>labourers is created, sufficient to remove all apprehen<lb
                        break="no"/>sion of a dearth of employment for as many as may
                    <lb/>arise.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That this Council would particulary in<lb break="no"/>stance the large
                    and increasing sums at the credit of <lb/>the working classes in the Savings
                    Bank of New South <lb/>Wales, as affording gratifying evidence of their pros<lb
                        break="no"/>perous condition, the deposits having increased from
                    <lb/>t24,469, the amount on 31st December 1835, to t127,000 <lb/>on 31st August
                    1840.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That great additiona advantage must <lb/>accrue to the mother country
                    from the large consump<lb break="no"/>tion in this colony of British produce and
                        manufac<lb break="no"/>tures, the declared value of which, from 1826 to
                    1839, <lb/>according to the official returns for that period, <lb/>amounted to
                    more than eight millions sterling, having <lb/>progressively increased from
                    t280,000, the amount in <lb/>1826, to t1,251,969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports
                    from <lb/>the colony, including the produce of the fisheries, in<lb break="no"
                    />creased from t106,600 in the former year, to t948,776 <lb/>in the
                    latter&#x2013;the total amount being t6,187,530 for the <lb/>whole period.</p>
                <p>Resolved. That the trade between the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try and this
                    colony, together with the whale fisheries <lb/>in the adjourning seas, also
                    affords a valuable nursery <lb/>for seamen, important in this respect, in
                    proportion to <lb/>the distance from Great Britain, and calculated to
                    <lb/>strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that <lb/>this field for the
                    employment of British shipping must <lb/>increase with the growing prosperity of
                    the colony&#x2013; <lb/>considerations which appear to this Council to consti<lb
                        break="no"/>tute a strong additional claim, on the part of the colony,
                    <lb/>to the fostering care of the British Government.</p>

                    <lb/>Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the <lb/>river on her voyage
                    to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. <lb/>The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she
                    takes out 50 <lb/>mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the
                    <lb/>Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of <lb/>other passengers,
                    amongst whom are Mr Swainson, <lb/>Chief Justice, and Mr Martin,
                    Attorney-General, of <lb/>the new colony, to which sations they have been re<lb
                        break="no"/>cently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort <lb/>of the
                    emigrants on board were certainly very com<lb break="no"/>plete ; and it must be

                <p>A very lively and interesting scene occurred on Fri<lb break="no"/>day, off the

                    of all on board, <lb/>the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern,
                    <lb/>where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large <lb/>room. The Duke
                    of Sussex took the chair, and was <lb/>supported on the right by the Earl of
                    Devon, and on <lb/>the left by Jos. Somes, Esq., the Governor of the Com<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>pany. Among the guests were the Duchess of Inver<lb break="no"/>ness, the

                    Hill, Clements, Viscount <lb/>Ebrington, M.P., the Hon. Frederick Dundas, Hon.

                    C. Brees, Captain <lb/>Sinclair, R.N.,&amp;c. &amp;c. The rapid progress which
                    the <lb/>grand undertaking of colonizing New Zealand has <lb/>made, was more
                    than once alluded to by his Royal <lb/>Highness and other distinguished speakers
                    on both <lb/>sides of politics, and its many advantages were dwelt <lb/>upon
                    with much sincerity of feeling. Several gentle<lb break="no"/>men of the first
                    families go out with this expedition, <lb/>which will be closely followed by
                    several first-rate <lb/>ships.</p>

                <p>We have not the previous Returns at hand, <lb/>but we believe that a larger

                    carries off 250, leaving 850 to swell the <lb/>Census.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Music Hall.</hi>&#x2013;We stated, about two month <lb/>ago,
                    that, in connection with other improvements <lb/>in the Assembly Rooms, a plan
                    was under consi<lb break="no"/>deration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now
                    <lb/>happy to announce, that at a meeting of the pro<lb break="no"/>prietors of
                    the Rooms last week, full pwers were <lb/>given to the Directors to take the
                    requisite steps <lb/>for carrying the design into execution. The de<lb

                    soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid <lb/>hall, constructed with a due
                    regard to the accom<lb break="no"/>modation both of professional men and the
                    public, <lb/>and with a minute attention to the most recent <lb/>improvements,
                    by which full effect is secured to <lb/>musical performances when conducted on a

                    />cidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, <lb/>arrived in Edinburgh on
                    the very day when this <lb/>resolution was come to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Martin's Paintings.</hi>&#x2013;The exhibition of <lb/>these
                    celebrated paintings in this city has already, <lb/>we believe, attracted many
                    visitors. They are <lb/>truly wonderful creations, and possess a power <lb/>and
                    grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar <lb/>to the public, convey but a
                    faint conception. In <lb/>contemplating " the Deluge," the spectator is so
                    <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details;
                    <lb/>but these will be found on inspection to be among <lb/>the most interesting
                    features of the picture. The <lb/>groups of perishing beings are exquisitely
                    wrought, <lb/>while everything is made to contribute to the <lb/>terrific
                    grandeur of the catastrophe. The other <lb/>two pictures&#x2013;"Pandemonium"
                    and "the Rivers <lb/>of Bliss," are smaller in size, but equally indica<lb
                        break="no"/>tive of the high poetic genius of the artist. No<lb break="no"
                    />thing could be more striking than the contrast <lb/>these pictures present to
                    each other&#x2013;the one fear<lb break="no"/>ful beyond expression, the other
                    exhibiting a <lb/>heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the <lb/>eye rests
                    with delight. There are several other <lb/>valuable paintings in this

                    From the map which <lb/>accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct <lb/>idea

                    extends in latitude <lb/>from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is un<lb

                    and 171. Its position is directly <lb/>south from New Zealand, and at the
                    distance of <lb/>1500 geographical miles. The length of the part <lb/>seen was
                    fully 500 miles. It was girt with a bor<lb break="no"/>der of ice many miles in
                    breadth, which rendered <lb/>it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed
                    <lb/>at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, <lb/>which was traced for
                    300 miles east from Victoria <lb/>Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers
                    <lb/>after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice <lb/>at 66. The land " rose
                    in lofy peaks from 9000 <lb/>to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with
                    <lb/>eternal snow; the <hi rend="italic">glaciers</hi> descended from <lb/>near

                    landed on an island, which they found <lb/>to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th
                    January, <lb/>in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered <lb/>a
                    magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame <lb/>in a splendid profusion," and
                    named it Mount <lb/>Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after <lb/>the
                    other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance <lb/>of less than half a mile from
                    the ice cliffs which <lb/>barred their progress southward, they had sound<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, <lb/>reached the bottom,
                    and, including the 150 feet <lb/>above water, <hi rend="italic">must have had an
                        elevation fo 2000 feet</hi>
                    <lb/>of thereabout. The observations on the dip and <lb/>declination induced
                    them to place the South Mag<lb break="no"/>netic Pole in latitude 76, and east
                    longitude <lb/>153; and they considered its position as well as<lb break="no"

                    was a point 160 miles from <lb/>it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole
                    <lb/>is probably within that region, though this can<lb break="no"/>not be

                    to <lb/>learn whether our practise in Britain would not <lb/>furnish hints for
                    improvement. Unluckily, the <lb/>very first specimens of our piety which met him
                    <lb/>were the sweetie case, and that of the poor man <lb/>Key who was
                    excommunicated for burying his <lb/>child on Sunday. These will of course figure
                    in <lb/>the very front of the officer's report as the na<lb break="no"/>tural
                    fruits of our system, and we may guess <lb/>what their effect will be in
                    reconciling the Ger<lb break="no"/>mans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We
                    <lb/>can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that <lb/>the fame of their
                    exploits has already travelled, by <lb/>the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to
                    the utter<lb break="no"/>most parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement
                    <lb/>of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and <lb/>the shepherds of the

                    eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and <lb/>splendour was witnessed in this
                    quarter. The <lb/>evening was very clear, the sky being without a <lb/>cloud,
                    and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, <lb/>a dazzling blaze of light burst
                    from the sky, illu<lb break="no"/>minating Benlomond and the distant hills, the
                    <lb/>Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth <lb/>and air on every side
                    as far as the eye could reach, <lb/>with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The
                        pheno<lb break="no"/>menon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong
                    <lb/>shape, and apparently almost twice the size of <lb/>the moon, having at the
                    time somewhat of the <lb/>same silvery appearance as that luminary, but
                    <lb/>flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to <lb/>dazzle the eyes. A
                    tail of fire somewhat re<lb break="no"/>sembling that of a rocket, but composed
                    of the <lb/>most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind <lb/>it for a short
                    distance, adding much to its spen<lb break="no"/>dour, and giving the whole an
                    appearance at once <lb/>singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it
                    <lb/>disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appear<lb break="no"/>ance, and then
                    burst for an instant enve<lb break="no"/>loping the earth and sky in a blaze as
                    bright and <lb/>dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared <lb/>to pass
                    from the south to the north, inclining to<lb break="no"/>wards the earth. To the
                    eye it seemed to burst <lb/>and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another me<lb

                    and splendour, was observed falling in <lb/>a quartr rather farther to the

                    <lb/>notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with <lb/>that first described in

                    <lb/>leaving the animal to follow, as he was wont to <lb/>do, to the stable. On
                    looking about, he observed <lb/>a young man, whom he supposed to be his son,
                    <lb/>take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly <lb/>afterwards the son came
                    into the house, and the <lb/>question of "Where is the pony?" soon convinced
                    <lb/>the parties that it was stolen. They immediately <lb/>proceeded in search,
                    and while the gentleman <lb/>was giving information at the Police-Office, his
                    <lb/>son discovered the pony with a rider on the North <lb/>Bridge. He
                    immediately seized the reins and <lb/>made a clutch at the thief; but the latter
                    very <lb/>adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side, <lb/>ran down the
                    Fleshmarket stairs, and escaped.</p>

                    into a deep well. His companion was found <lb/>standing weeping at the edge. The

                    have not the <lb/>influence to get themselves placed in municipal
                    <lb/>authority, have for a good number of years endea<lb break="no"/>voured to
                    embarass the party in power, by attack<lb break="no"/>ing the credit of the
                    community. The unfavour<lb break="no"/>about state of trade and the leniency of
                    the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil in not enforcing during the last year the ex<lb
                        break="no"/>actions on the owners of property, for entries, &amp;c.
                    <lb/>falling due, caused a deficiency of nearly t300 <lb/>in the usual amount of
                    revenue. This simple <lb/>circumstance was taken advantage of, though
                    <lb/>nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudi<lb break="no"/>cial to the
                    town's credit were placed in the hands <lb/>of every credito that could be found
                    by the indi<lb break="no"/>viduals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm
                    <lb/>raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the <lb/>same party in the
                    Council during the last five <lb/>days gave currency to another statement which
                    <lb/>they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Pro<lb break="no"/>vost having
                    commenced to secure himself by <lb/>drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was
                    he <lb/>had not drawn out a penny. From the position <lb/>to which which the
                    affiars the town are now driven <lb/>a full and public exposure of these matters
                    will <lb/>soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council <lb/>have been
                    negotiating for such a loan of money <lb/>as will pay off those who are
                    dissatisfied, which <lb/>in the ordinary state of the money market they
                    <lb/>would long since have obtained, though at present <lb/>that is difficult.
                    As regards risk to the creditors, <lb/>from the best informed quarters we are
                    assured <lb/>there is none. More than one-third of the whole <lb/>debts of the
                    town are due to the Bank and the <lb/>members of Council, or their immediate
                    friends, <lb/>and fully a half of the debt against the river is due <lb/>to the
                    same parties. This we should conceive the <lb/>strongest proof that could be
                    adduced of the con<lb break="no"/>fidence of those who should best know the

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Falkland Islands</hi> have been nominally a <lb/>British
                    colony for some years; but, in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of representations
                    made to Government by <lb/>various persons interested in the trade to the South
                    <lb/>Seas, a plan has at least been drawn up for esta<lb break="no"/>blishing a
                    body of settlers in these islands. It <lb/>was submitted to the late Ministers,
                    who referred <lb/>it to the Commissioners of Emigration and the <lb/>Lords of
                    the Admiralty, by both of whom it was <lb/>approved. Rules were prepared by the
                        Com<lb break="no"/>missioners of Emigration ; a vote of t3750 was <lb/>put
                    into the estimates for the first year's ex<lb break="no"/>pense, and, we
                    suppose, passed. If steps have <lb/>not been taken already to send out
                    emigrants, we <lb/>presume they will be taken about the beginning <lb/>of next
                    winter, which is their summer.</p>
                <p>These islands are about 300 miles from the <lb/>south extremity of the American
                    continent, in a <lb/>latitude corresponding with that of London. <lb/>Their
                    climate, however, very closely resembles <lb/>that of Shetland. They have cold
                    summers and <lb/>mild winters. Snow seldom lies in them; but <lb/>owing to their
                    humidity and want of sunshine, <lb/>and the stormy winds which blow almost
                        con<lb break="no"/>stantly, wheat of barley could not be raised in
                    <lb/>them, and even oats might turn out to be a pre<lb break="no"/>carious crop.
                    It is doubted also if wood will <lb/>grow, and at present there is not a single
                    tree in <lb/>the islands. Turnips and potatoes succeed well, <lb/>and there is
                    an abundance of good grass, upon which <lb/>some thousands of black cattle,
                    horses, and hogs, <lb/>thrive in the wild state, and sheep have been in<lb
                        break="no"/>troduced and found to do well. Extensive peat<lb break="no"
                    />bogs exist, which will afford a sufficient supply of <lb/>fuel. The present
                    population consists of twenty<lb break="no"/> five persons, young and
                    old&#x2013;one-half of them <lb/>British, the other Gauchos, South American
                        In<lb break="no"/>dians of a semi-civilised description. They are <lb/>all
                    stationed at Port-Louis, a fine natural har<lb break="no"/>bour, where a British
                    officer resides.</p>
                <p>The islands are numerous, but all very small <lb/>except two, whose area is
                    estimated at 13,000 <lb/>square miles, or nearly half the extent of Scot<lb
                        break="no"/>land. They are deeply perforated by arms of the <lb/>sea, and
                    probably afford a greater number of fine <lb/>natural harbours than any country
                    of equal ex<lb break="no"/>tent in the world. Their shores afford excellent
                    <lb/>fish of many kinds, and seals are exceedingly <lb/>numerous.</p>
                <p>The great object in establishing a colony here <lb/>is to provide a harbour of
                    refuge and place of re<lb break="no"/>fitment for our ships frequenting the
                    South Seas, <lb/>which are yearly increasing in number. Every <lb/>vessel going
                    to the Pacific Ocean, or coming from <lb/>it, passes within sight of these
                    islands, or near <lb/>them. At present 60 or 70 British ships pass <lb/>these
                    islands annually coming from Chili or Peru, <lb/>and 20 more engaged in the
                    whale fishery. The <lb/>trade to New South Wales employs 236 vessels, <lb/>most
                    of which return to England by this route, <lb/>which will also be preferred by
                    vessels trading to <lb/>New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Port Philip, <lb/>and
                    probably South Australia. From Sydney or <lb/>Hort Town the distance is nearly
                    the same by <lb/>Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, but the <lb/>prevalence of
                    westerly winds in the parallel be<lb break="no"/>yond the 30th, renders the
                    latter route the more <lb/>advantageous on the outward voyage, and the
                    <lb/>former on the return. The Falkland Islands are <lb/>about half as distant
                    from Britain as New South <lb/>Wales.</p>
                <p>The Emigration Board recommend that Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should send out
                    two surveyors to select an <lb/>eligible site for a town, and to lay out the
                    land in <lb/>blocks of half a square mile, which may be subdivid<lb break="no"
                    />ed. It is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at <lb/>12s. per acre, and to
                    expend part of the money in <lb/>carrying out additional settlers, part in
                    defraying <lb/>the colonial outlay. There are 40,000 wild cattle in <lb/>the
                    largest island, the privilege of shooting which, <lb/>or catching and taming
                    them, might be sold to <lb/>the settlers or a company. The climate is unin<lb
                        break="no"/>viting, but there is little doubt that persons ac<lb break="no"
                    />customed to grazing or sheep farming, or to seal<lb break="no"/> hunting, or
                    deep-sea fishery, might drive a profit<lb break="no"/>able trade here. A vast
                    number of ships, making <lb/>long voyages, American, French, Dutch, as well
                    <lb/>as British, pass the islands, and to these it would <lb/>be a great
                    accommodation to find supplies of pro<lb break="no"/>visions and the means of
                    refitting here. Some of <lb/>our starving population in the North of Scotland
                    <lb/>or the Islands, might better their circumstances <lb/>by removing to the
                    Falkland Islands.</p>

                <p>(<hi rend="italic">From the Morning Chronicle.</hi>)</p>
                <p>The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zea<lb break="no"/>land Company to Lord
                    John Russell will serve to re<lb break="no"/>move all apprehensions, if any are
                    yet entertained, <lb/>with regard to the relations between that colony and
                    <lb/>the Government of the parent state. Many of the first <lb/>names in the
                    country honoured this splendid banquet <lb/>by their presence ; and men of all
                    parties, Tories, <lb/>Whigs, and Radicals, appeared to be actuated only <lb/>by
                    one common feeling.</p>
                <p>The public are now tolerably familiar with the <lb/>natural advantages of New
                    Zealand, which appears <lb/>destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great
                    <lb/>Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton, with <lb/>must felicity,
                    observed, " that the position of the New <lb/>Zealand islands on the map, their
                    climate, fertility, <lb/>abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most
                    <lb/>suited to the whale fisheries, and, above all, the <lb/>character to the
                    native population, led him to antici<lb break="no"/>pate that these islands were
                    likely to become the <lb/>great seat of wealth and naval power." Lord John
                    <lb/>Russell was justly complimented, on all hands, for <lb/>adding these
                    important islands to the great colonial <lb/>empire of this country.</p>
                <p>The speech of Lord John Russell was much and <lb/>deservedly applauded.</p>
                <p>"I believe," said his lordship, "that the foundation <lb/>of this colony of New
                    Zealand will tend to the honour <lb/>and dignity of the Crow, and will tend to
                    the pros<lb break="no"/>perity and future greatness of the nation (cheers). It
                    <lb/>was on this ground, and for these reasons, that I lent <lb/>my humble
                    efforts in support of those exertions that <lb/>had been made, and were about to
                    be made, by the <lb/>New Zealand Company. Gentlemen, in so doing, I <lb/>should
                    be unworthy of your approbation if I took <lb/>any extraordinary merit to myself
                    ; for, in the <lb/>first place, the principle of colonization, the value of
                    <lb/>colonies to this country, the means they afford of aug<lb break="no"
                    />menting her strength, of adding to her power, of pro<lb break="no"/>moting her
                    wealth, and of increasing her prosperity&#x2013; <lb/>all this has been
                    ascertained and demonstrated by the <lb/>enlightened discussions of past years
                    (hear, hear). With <lb/>regard to the best mode of colonization, likewise, we
                    <lb/>have had the advantage and assistance of the most en<lb break="no"
                    />lightened opinions, and the most adverse discussion <lb/>I, therefore, can
                    only take to myself the merit of not <lb/>being blind to the importance and
                    value of those opi<lb break="no"/>nions and discussions (hear, and cheers)"</p>
                <p>But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his <lb/>own merits, in
                    recommending the adoption of these <lb/>islands by the Crown, it was perfectly
                    well understood <lb/>by all present that, for his conduct with respect to
                    <lb/>his colony, he has truly entitled himself to the grati<lb break="no"/>tude
                    of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him <lb/>a deserved tribute when he
                    complimented him for the <lb/>sagacity with which he had appreciated the
                        import<lb break="no"/>ance of these islands, so soon as he had entered on
                    the <lb/>administration of colonial affairs, and for the judicious <lb/>measure
                    of setting up the British flag in them.</p>
                <p>We may observe that the health of her Majesty's <lb/>Ministers, proposed by Mr
                    Hutt, M.P., was received <lb/>with loud and universal cheering, and that Mr
                        La<lb break="no"/>bouchere's speech, which was a very good one, was
                    <lb/>well received. Upon the whole, Lord John's visit to <lb/>the City on this
                    occasion is calculated to gain the <lb/>Government favour among the commercial
                    classes. <lb/>His lordship may well be proud, that though New <lb/>Zealand was
                    formally taken possession of in the name <lb/>of the Sovereign of this country
                    many years ago, it <lb/>was reserved for him to make it a British colony.</p>

                <p><pb/>There is something curious in the preference <lb/>which the emigrants from
                    England, Scotland, and <lb/>Ireland display for different localities. The pro<lb
                        break="no"/>portions emigrating the countries below are as
                    <lb/>follows:&#x2013;</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Emigrants</hi>
                    <lb/>English Per cent. Scottish Per cent. Irish Per Cent. <lb/>To United States,
                    54, 14 1/2, 12 <lb/>&#x2013; Sydney, 17, 21 1/2, 7 <lb/>&#x2013; Canada, 8 1/2,
                    25, 50 <lb/>&#x2013; Port-Philip, 8, 14, 7</p>
                <p>As the table expressly bears to be " a return of <lb/>the persons who have <hi
                        rend="italic">emigrated</hi>," we can scarcely <lb/>suppose that it includes
                    persons who went out to <lb/>the countries mentioned on business, without any
                    <lb/>intention of settling. In the report for Canada, <lb/>the number who went
                    to the United States in <lb/>1841, is stated to be only 32,500, or about two<lb
                        break="no"/> thirds of what stands in the above table.</p>
                <p>It will be observed, that not a single emigrant <lb/>to India or Ceylon appears
                    in the table; yet sure<lb break="no"/>ly some persons go with the express view
                    of re<lb break="no"/>maining in these countries.</p>
                <p>The number of person who were enabled to <lb/>emigrate in 1841 by means of
                    bounties payable in <lb/>the colonies, was, for New South Wales 22,752, <lb/>for
                    Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remem<lb break="no"/>bered that New South
                    Wales includes Port<lb break="no"/> Philip.</p>
                <p>There are returns of land sold, but not in a <lb/>very perfect form. In Canada,
                    in the year 1839, <lb/>1840, and 1841, the lands sold were 176,518 acres.
                    <lb/>The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in Lower, and <lb/>12s. to 13s. in
                    Upper Canada; the lands granted <lb/>without sale were 194,000 acres, exclusive
                    of those <lb/>for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia, New <lb/>Brunswick, and
                    Cape Breton, about 200,000 acres <lb/>have been sold at prices varying from 2s.
                    3d. to <lb/>3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>At the Cape, 129,000 acres have been sold in the <lb/>three years, at prices from
                    2s. 5d. to 3s. 3d.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lands sold in New South Wales</hi>
                    <lb/>Acres. Average Price. <lb/>Sydney District&#x2013;1839, 234,272, 8s 2 1/2d.
                    <lb/>1840, 105,900, 18s. 8 1/2d. <lb/>1841, 15,790, 20s. 0 1/2d.

                <p>The sales were chiefly by auction.</p>
                <p>In Van Diemen's Land, the sales in 1839, 1840, <lb/>were about 130,000 acres, at
                    10s. or 11s.; in West<lb break="no"/>ern Australia (Swan River), in 1839, 1840,
                    1841, <lb/>the sales were 71,000 acres, from 6s. 1d. to 11s.; in <lb/>South
                    Australia, 55,000 acres, at 20s. The sales <lb/>of land are no bad index of the
                    progress of the <lb/>colonies in capital and cultivation; and, accord<lb
                        break="no"/>ing to this criterion, it will be seen, that those <lb/>which
                    were advancing most rapidly in the three <lb/>years, were Sydney and
                    Port-Philip. The money <lb/>received in payment of land in these two colonies
                    <lb/>in 1839 and 1840, amounted to t307,647; and, if <lb/>we understand the
                    report correctly, the whole of <lb/>this sum is applicable to emigration, that
                    is, to <lb/>defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants.</p>
                <p>The 118,592 emigrants probably carried with <lb/>them, or expended on their
                    passage, twenty <lb/>pounds each; and thus the money which left the <lb/>country
                    must have amounted to upwards of two <lb/>millions.</p>
                <p>This gigantic emigration one of the things <lb/>which convey an idea of the
                    immense resources of <lb/>Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the
                    <lb/>ninth part of the population of Europe; and we <lb/>believe it may be
                    safely said, that all the other <lb/>eight parts do not send out half the number
                    of <lb/>emigrants annually which are sent by the British <lb/>Isles alone.</p>

                <p>The Company was established and incorporated <lb/>(and is now in full operation)
                    to carry out in Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia a principle which has been acted on
                    with great <lb/>success elsewhere, namely, that of taking up money <lb/>in this
                    country, at a moderate rate of interest, on <lb/>the credit of a large invested
                    capital, and laying it <lb/>out on undoubted freehold security, at a higher
                    rate.</p>
                <p>The Company is now prepared to grant transferable <lb/>notes, under the
                    Corporation seal, to persons desirous <lb/>of advancing Money to the Company on
                    loan. The <lb/>notes will be for t100 each, or any larger sum desired <lb/>by
                    the lender, and will be made payable at any period <lb/>which may be agreed
                    upon, not being shorter than <lb/>two years. The notes will bear interest at the
                    rate <lb/>of five per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly (on <lb/>the 15th
                    January and 15th July), on the production <lb/>of the half-yearly vouchers,
                    which will be annexed <lb/>to each note: these vouchers, or coupons, will render
                    <lb/>it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the <lb/>note itself
                    until the principal becomes due. The <lb/>form of note has been preferred to
                    that of bond, as <lb/>admitting of transfer without expense or trouble,
                    <lb/>whilst it affords equal security to the holder.</p>
                <p>The Colonial Board has been established in Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, and the
                    operation of the Company are at pre<lb break="no"/>sent confined to New South
                    Wales.</p>
                <p>Security being the first object of the Company, all <lb/>the arrangements have
                    been framed with the view to <lb/>attain that end.</p>
                <p>The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per <lb/>cent, although the current
                    rate is much higher. <lb/>The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral se<lb
                        break="no"/>curity) must not be of less value than double <lb/>the amount of
                    the loan. <lb/>The non-payment of interest on the day it be<lb break="no"/>comes
                    due, subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per <lb/>cent, additional interest for the
                    period in ar<lb break="no"/>rear; and all parties in default for ten days
                    <lb/>are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of <lb/>the Company "without
                    further instructions" <lb/>and "without distinction or exception of any
                    <lb/>person whatever." <lb/>The Colonial Board only draws on the Company,
                    <lb/>as loans are agreed on; their bills must be ad<lb break="no"/>vertised for
                    public competition and the pur<lb break="no"/>chasers pay the amount, in
                    exchange for the <lb/>Bill, to the Bank of Australasia (the Capital <lb/>of
                    which is t1,200,00) to the credit of the <lb/>Company, to be drawn out by checks
                    of <lb/>the Colonial Board in favour of the borrow<lb break="no"/>ers as the
                    mortgages are completed.</p>
                <p>The high character of the members of the Colonial <lb/>Board, affords the fullest
                    assurance that these ar<lb break="no"/>rangements will be strictly adhered to in
                    spirit as <lb/>well as in form; no difficulty has been experienced <lb/>in
                    investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by <lb/>the instructions of the
                    Court of Directors: indeed the <lb/>Chairman of the Colonial Board states that
                    "he does <lb/>not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment <lb/>of all
                    the funds which may be placed at the disposal <lb/>of the Colonial Board."</p>
                <p>The high rate of interest in Australia, has at<lb break="no"/>tracted much
                    private capital from this country to be <lb/>invested in mortgages. These
                    investments have <lb/>been made through the agency of individuals or mer<lb
                        break="no"/>cantile firms, and therefore subject to contingencies <lb/>from
                    which the Company is exempt. To those who <lb/>may desire to make such
                    investments, it must be ob<lb break="no"/>vois that the stock of the Company
                    presents a much <lb/>superior security, and the prospect of a greatly in<lb
                        break="no"/>creased return, inasmuch as the Company derives a <lb/>large
                    profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia, <lb/>the money borrowed here at
                    half that rate.</p>
                <p>It is equally clear that those who merely seek tem<lb break="no"/>porary
                    employment for their money without becoming <lb/>shareholders, cannot have a
                    better security than the <lb/>Promissory Notes of the Company, for the due
                        pay<lb break="no"/>ment of which, the whole capital of the Company, <lb/>as
                    well as the mortgages on which the money is laid <lb/>out, stand pledged. Every
                    shareholder is required <lb/>to execute in a Deed of Covenant, by which he
                    becomes <lb/>bound to pay to the full amount of his shares, and the <lb/>Charter
                    supplies Creditors with the utmost facility <lb/>in enforcing demands against
                    the Company. When <lb/>it is considered that the funds of the Company <lb/>here
                    are kept in Government Securities and no <lb/>money lent in Australia, except on
                    the best mort<lb break="no"/>gages on land, with collateral security in
                    addition, <lb/>it may be fairly asserted, that in many respects the
                    <lb/>Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided prefe<lb break="no"/>rence over
                    mortgages in this country, which gene<lb break="no"/>rally bear one per cent.
                    less interest than that paid <lb/>by the Company.</p>
                <p>The Charter provides that the sums borrowed <lb/>shall not exceed four times the
                    amount of capital <lb/>paid up.</p>
                <p>That the whole capital of the Company, and all <lb/>the mortgages on which their
                    money is lent, in Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia, shall constitute a security to the
                    lenders of <lb/>money to the Company.</p>
                <p>That the mortgages are to be on land, with the <lb/>power of taking collateral
                    security on stock, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>That every mortgage shall be registered&#x2013;the re<lb break="no"/>gister to
                    contain such particulars as the Governor <lb/>of the colony may deem
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>That a copy of the register of the mortgages <lb/>shall be kept at the office of
                    the Company, in Lon<lb break="no"/>don, for the information of the share-holders
                    and <lb/>lenders.</p>
                <p>That an annual report be made to the Lords of the <lb/>Treasury of all sums
                    borrowed by the Company, and <lb/>of the appropriation of them.</p>

                <p><pb n="5"/> Yesterday forenoon arrived at Spithead, the <lb/>Lord Dorcester
                    merchantman, Edward Howe, <lb/>master, bound from Halifax for London.</p>
                <p>In this ship came six Cherokee Chiefs, of the <lb/>first rank, one of them born
                    in England.</p>
                <p>As soon as their arrival was announced in form, <lb/>Sir Andrew Douglas,
                    Commander of the Alcide, <lb/>of 74 guns, sent his barge to bring them ashore
                    <lb/>to Portsmouth; and, upon landing, they went to <lb/>Bradley's, the crown
                    Inn.</p>
                <p>The object of these Chiefs coming to this coun<lb break="no"/>try is, to
                    endeavour to form a connection with the <lb/>English Government, in order to
                    attempt the re<lb break="no"/>duction of Mexico, near which place they have
                    <lb/>20,000 men in arms, and can raise 30,000 more <lb/>in a short time.</p>
                <p>The Cherokees have menaced that country for <lb/>these last three years, and are
                    favoured by great <lb/>number of the inhabitants in the Spanish settle<lb
                        break="no"/>ments; should they, therefore, procure respectable
                    <lb/>assistance from England, the New World will be <lb/>a certain conquest, and
                    open a source of trade and <lb/>wealth to this nation, that will more than
                        com<lb break="no"/>pensate for the loss of America, and the expence <lb/>of
                    attaining that grand object.</p>
                <p>These Indian Chiefs are dressed in the habit of <lb/>their country, with their
                    faces painted in an ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary manner. They waited on Colonel
                    <lb/>Trigge, of the 12th regiment of foot, and some <lb/>other officers of

                    <lb/>By the Fanny, Capt. Bryen, arrived in twenty <lb/>four days from New York,
                    we have American <lb/>papers, of which we give the following important
                    <lb/>intelligence:&#x2013;</p>
                <p>It is an undoubted truth, (Strange as it may <lb/>appear) that the Baron
                    D'Carondolet, Governor <lb/>of Louisiana, and Governor O'Neal, of Pensaco<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>la, have opened the shores of the King of Spain, <lb/>in West-Florida, to
                    the Creeks and Cherokees, <lb/>and delivered them arms and ammunition in abun<lb
                        break="no"/>dance, advising and stimulating them to go to <lb/>war against
                    the frontier inhabitants of the United <lb/>States, and that quickly, that now
                    or never was <lb/>the time, while the United States were engaged <lb/>with the
                    northern tribes.</p>
                <p>On the 30th of September, about midnight <lb/>John Buchanan's station, four miles
                    south of Nash<lb break="no"/>ville,) at which sundry families had collected, and
                    <lb/>fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of <lb/>Creeks and Lower Cherokees,
                    supposed to con<lb break="no"/>sist of three of our hundred. Their approach
                    <lb/>was suspected by the running of cattle, that had <lb/>taken fright at them,
                    and upon examination, they <lb/>were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of
                    <lb/>the gate, and from the place and distance they <lb/>received the first fire
                    from the man who discover<lb break="no"/>ed them John M'Rocy. They immediately
                        re<lb break="no"/>turned the fire, and continued a very heavy and
                    <lb/>constant firing upon the station, blockhouses sur<lb break="no"/>rounded
                    with a stockade for an hour, and were re<lb break="no"/>pulsed with considerable
                    loss, without injuring <lb/>man, woman, or child, in the station.</p>
                <p>During the whole time of the attack, the In<lb break="no"/>dians were never more
                    distant than ten yards from <lb/>the Block House, and often in large numbers
                    <lb/>close round the lower walls, attempting to put <lb/>fire to it. One
                    ascended the roof with a torch, <lb/>where he was shot, and falling to the
                    ground, re<lb break="no"/>newed his attempts to fire the bottom logs, and
                    <lb/>was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through <lb/>a port hole of the
                        over<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ing, which lodged in <lb/>the
                    roof in the circumference of the bat, and those <lb/>sticking in the walls on
                    the outside are innume<lb break="no"/>rable.</p>
                <p>Undoubted advices have been received that as <lb/>early at the 18th of September,
                    as many as 500 <lb/>Creeks passed the Tennessee, and the lower Chero<lb
                        break="no"/>kee towns, and below, as on their way they de<lb break="no"
                    />cared to make war on Cumberland&#x2013;and that they <lb/>were joined by about
                    100 Cherokees of those <lb/>towns.&#x2013;This must have been the party that
                        attack<lb break="no"/>ed Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was ex<lb
                        break="no"/>pected, but it is now hoped, that the check they <lb/>have
                    received will induce them to return without <lb/>making further attempts upon
                    that settlement.</p>
                <p>On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the <lb/>head of Crooked Creek, (a
                    branch of Little Ri<lb break="no"/>ver) at which there was a serjeant's command,
                    of <lb/>Cape, Crawford's company, was attacked, by sur<lb break="no"/>prise,
                    about an hour and a half in the night, by <lb/>a party of Indians, commanded by
                    a Cherokee of <lb/>Will's Town called the Tail, a brother of the <lb/>Bench, and
                    Talohteske, consisting of 3 other Che<lb break="no"/>rokees and 5 Creeks.</p>
                <p>James Paul was killed in the knife, and George <lb/>Morse and Robert Sharp, at a
                    fire on the outside <lb/>and John Shankland wounded, 3 horses were kil<lb
                        break="no"/>led, and 7 taken off.</p>
                <p>These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron <lb/>D'Carrondolet and Governor
                    O'Neal; and it is <lb/>due to Mr. Paton, their chief instrument, to add <lb/>he
                    has well acted his part!!!</p>
                <p>We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina), <lb/>that on Tuesday the 23d of
                    October last a fire <lb/>broke out in that town, owing to the negligence <lb/>of
                    a small negro girl, which consumed about 40 <lb/>dwelling houses and stores, and
                    28 buildings of <lb/>other descriptions.</p>

                <p>Our humanity was deeply affected by the dread<lb break="no"/>ful carnage made by
                    the Indians. You may be <lb/>assured that the number of Indians did not exceed
                    <lb/>1000, and that nothing saved General St. Clair, <lb/>and the remainder of
                    his army, but the great quan<lb break="no"/>tity of plunder he left to the
                    Indians; they were <lb/>composed of various tribes, and three-fourths of <lb/>of
                    them remained in the camp to plunder it, and to <lb/>take scalps, the trophies
                    of their victory; and he <lb/>that got most when he returned to his nation,
                        ac<lb break="no"/>quired the greatest share of glory; hence only a<lb
                        break="no"/>bout 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is un<lb break="no"
                    />der 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they <lb/>have obtained at so easy a
                    purchase, and the riches <lb/>they obtained by the plunder, and the provisions
                    <lb/>they found, will make them a more terrible foe <lb/>than ever they have
                    been; they boast of taking an <lb/>amazing quantity of powder and arms, which
                    they <lb/>wanted; many of them were only armed with <lb/>spears and hatchets,
                    and I have no doubt but if a<lb break="no"/>nother expedition should be set on
                    foot, that they <lb/>will be met by three times the number of Indians. <lb/>The
                    indian tribes of nations who live many hun<lb break="no"/>dred miles back have
                    all entered into an association, <lb/>and made the present war a common concern,
                    they <lb/>to oppose what they call the common enemy. The <lb/>warriors of the
                    different tribes so united are not <lb/>less than 15 or 20,000; numbers of the
                    chiefs of <lb/>ten or twelve numerous nations were here last sum<lb break="no"
                    />mer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make <lb/>peace, and offered his
                    mediations; he told them he <lb/>was at peace with the United States, and could
                    <lb/>give them no assistance. Their answer was, that <lb/>the enemy was in their
                    country, and would not <lb/>make peace with them, but on term dishonourable,
                    <lb/>and at the expense of their country, and that they <lb/>had determined to
                    die before they would accept of <lb/>such terms. They felt much dissatisfied
                    with the <lb/>answer they received, and departed with a full de<lb break="no"
                    />termination to defend their country with the last <lb/>of their blood.</p>
                <p>You may depend on it, that many years will e<lb break="no"/>lapse, and many
                    thousand men be expended before <lb/>the United States will, by the present
                    measures, <lb/>be able to possess the country in contest; and I <lb/>may also
                    add, that I have great apprehensions, that <cb/>
                    <lb/>desolation and destruction will be the consequence <lb/>on the frontiers of
                    the Ohio this winter and next <lb/>spring; I would to God some steps might be
                        tak<lb break="no"/>en to prevent them. I have no doubt the coun<lb

                <p>"Last Sunday evening came to this town a <lb/>young man from Cat-fish, which he
                    left about two <lb/>weeks ago, and who gave us the following pleasing
                    <lb/>interesting, and important intelligence, viz, that <lb/>two days before he
                    left Cat-fish, two men arrived <lb/>there from Licking, who informed, that they
                    had <lb/>been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horse<lb break="no"/>back
                    from Kentucky, under General Scott; that <lb/>they left Licking on the
                    expedition a few days be<lb break="no"/>fore Christmas; that General Scott
                    dispatched <lb/>three spies in advance, who, when they arrived a<lb break="no"
                    />bout 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. <lb/>Clair was defeated they
                    discovered a large body of <lb/>Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with
                    the <lb/>plunder they had taken, riding the bullocks, dan<lb break="no"/>cing,
                    &amp;c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that <lb/>on the information being
                    given to General Scott, <lb/>who, with the main body, were a few miles in the
                    <lb/>rear, he divided them into three divisions, advan<lb break="no"/>ced, and
                    fell on the enemy by surprise; that the <lb/>contest was short, but victorious,
                    on the side of the <lb/>volunteers, 700 of the enemy being killed on the
                    <lb/>spot, all the cannon and stores in their possession <lb/>retaken, and the
                    remainder of that savage body put <lb/>to flight; that General Scott, having
                    lost but six <lb/>men, returned to Licking in triumph, with most <lb/>of the
                    cattle, stores, &amp;c. leaving the cannon at <lb/>Fort Jefferson; that General
                    Scott had previous<lb break="no"/>ly gone out with 400 men, but finding his
                        num<lb break="no"/>ber was insufficient, was returning but met a body
                    <lb/>of 900 volunteers when, upon joining him, he im<lb break="no"/>mediately
                    proceeded in prosecution of his original <lb/>design which fortunately proved
                    successful.</p>
                <p>"Our informant further adds, that he saw a <lb/>Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of
                    January, at <lb/>Morgan Town, brought by Major Scott's expedi<lb break="no"
                    />tion, which corresponded with that given by the <lb/>two men at Cat Fish, and
                    that Gen. Scott brought <lb/>in near 700 scalps."</p>

                <p><pb n="3"/> Mr. Bowles, the Cherokee Chief, proposes to <lb/>introduce the art of
                    Printing amongst the Indi<lb break="no"/>ans, with whom he resides; and, for
                    this purpose, <lb/>has engaged two persons to accompany him on <lb/>his return,
                    and has provided himself with all the <lb/>implements of the art. The day fixed
                    for their <lb/>departure is the 20th of March</p>
                <p>The Indian companions of Mr. Bowles are two <lb/>Creeks and two Cherokees. these
                    nations, <lb/>though contiguous to each other, and in strict <lb/>union, differ
                    as essentially as possible in language <lb/>and manners. Both, however,
                    entertain the most <lb/>implacable animosity against the Spaniards, whose
                    <lb/>authority and dominions in South America they <lb/>make no scruple of
                    avowing they mean to try to <lb/>diminish.</p>

                <p><pb n="5"/> The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six <lb/>in number. They
                    have been indiscriminately styl<lb break="no"/>ed Cherokees, but three of them
                    only are of that <lb/>nation, and three are Creek Indians.&#x2013;They are
                    <lb/>all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty- <lb/>five or twenty-six.
                    These six Chiefs have 20,000 <lb/>warriors ready to take the field, and have the
                    <lb/>strongest wish to act in conjunction with the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish. They
                    travelled 3000 miles before the reach<lb break="no"/>ed Halifax, and were near
                    12 months in perform<lb break="no"/>ing the journey. From Halifax they went in
                    an <lb/>English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester, <lb/>by whom they were
                    sent over to England to con<lb break="no"/>cert their plans in person with the
                    Ministry.</p>
                <p>The object of their coming to this country may <lb/>be easily guessed at. They
                    long to make an at<lb break="no"/>tack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them
                    <lb/>was heard last night in the playhouse to say, he <lb/>hoped in six months
                    from this time to be in the <lb/>heart of Mexico.</p>

                    up with, and were attacked by <lb/>surprise, by a body of Indians, who were
                        con<lb break="no"/>cealed in the thickets on every side of a large
                    <lb/>plain; and on the first onset the militia, without <lb/>exchanging a single
                    fire, made a most precipitate <lb/>retreat, and left the regular troops to stand
                    the <lb/>whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was <lb/>short and bloody;
                    the troops were soon overpower<lb break="no"/>ed by numbers, and all fell,
                    except the two offi<lb break="no"/>ers and two or three privates, after
                    defending <lb/>themselves at their bayonet points with the great<lb break="no"
                    />est possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn, of <lb/>Franklin, was one of the
                    four that escaped, and <lb/>his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly
                    <lb/>circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat, <lb/>and by that means
                    screening himself from the eye <lb/>of his pursuers, that from any other
                    circumstance. <lb/>Captain Armstrong, who commanded the party, <lb/>likewise
                    made his escape, by plunging himself in<lb break="no"/>to a pond or swamp, up to
                    his neck, within two <lb/>hundred yards of the field of action, where he re<lb
                        break="no"/>mained the whole night, as a spectator of the hor<lb break="no"
                    />rid scene of the War Dance, performed over the <lb/>dead and wounded bodies of
                    the poor soldiers that <lb/>had fallen the preceding day, where their shrieks,
                    <lb/>mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, ren<lb break="no"/>dered his
                    situation shocking. After this, some <lb/>few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing
                    material, <lb/>until the second capital action, which happened <lb/>two days
                    after the army left the Miami village. <lb/>At ten miles distance from the town,
                    the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral ordered a halt, and detached from four to five
                    <lb/>hundred militia, and about sixty regular soldiers, <lb/>commanded by Major
                    Wylls, all under the com<lb break="no"/>mand of Col. Harden, with orders to
                    march back <lb/>to the town. On their first entrance into the <lb/>town, there
                    appeared a small body of Indians, <lb/>who immediately fled at the first onset,
                    and by <lb/>that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by <lb/>making their
                    flight into different directions, and <lb/>encouraging the militia to pursue; by
                    this means <lb/>the regular troops were left alone, and the Indi<lb break="no"
                    />ans had effected their design; for the moment <lb/>they found the small
                    handful of regular troops de<lb break="no"/>tached from the main body of
                    militia, they com<lb break="no"/>menced the attack with their whole force,
                        except<lb break="no"/>ing the flying parties that had diverted the mili<lb
                        break="no"/>tia; and although they soon found some part of <lb/>the militia
                    returning on their back, pursued their <lb/>object of routing and destroying the
                    troops; as <cb/>
                    <lb/>the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody <lb/>conflict on
                    each side, they effect. The regular <lb/>troops, all to nine, including two
                    commissioned <lb/>officers, were killed and disabled, and a total de<lb
                        break="no"/>feat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, <lb/>of Hartford,
                    and Lieut. Frothingham, of Mid<lb break="no"/>dletown. Of the militia, it is
                    said, about an hun<lb break="no"/>dred were killed, among whom were a number
                    <lb/>of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, <lb/>it appears, from some
                    cause, did not think it pru<lb break="no"/>dent to pursue their successes from
                    the field of ac<lb break="no"/>tion, for most of the troops that were not
                    killed, <lb/>or sorely wounded, made their escape, which they <lb/>never could
                    have done had the Indians pursued <lb/>with their usual fury.</p>
                <p>"Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the <lb/>Indians on this occasion; the
                    militia they appear<lb break="no"/>ed to despise, and with all the undautedness
                    <lb/>conceivable, threw down their guns, and rushed <lb/>upon the bayonets of
                    the regular soldiers; a great <lb/>number of them fell; but being so far
                    superior in <lb/>numbers soon overpowered them, for while the <lb/>poor soldier
                    had his bayonet in one Indiaman, <lb/>two more would sink their tomahawks in his
                    head. <lb/>The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead <lb/>and wounded were
                    left on the field in possession <lb/>of the savages.</p>
                <p>"No damage, of any consequence, has been <lb/>sustained in this part of the
                    country from the In<lb break="no"/>dians; but what effect the expedition may
                    have <lb/>on us, as relates to our frontier, it uncertain.&#x2013; <lb/>If the
                    Western Indians have any idea of treating <lb/>for peace, we shall be safe; if
                    not, we are much <lb/>exposed."</p>

                    the westward of Wil<lb break="no"/>mington, Delaware, which did great damage to
                    <lb/>many fields of grain, and blew down, in many <lb/>places, an immense
                    quantity of timber. The <lb/>hail in this storm was of an extraordinary
                        appear<lb break="no"/>ance; part of it being about two inches long, <lb/>and
                    of a very considerable circumference.</p>
                <p>On Saturday, the 1st inst. arrived at Wilming<lb break="no"/>ton, Delaware, the
                    brig Maria, Capt. fort, from <lb/>Londonderry, with 200 passengers.</p>
                <p>On the 4th inst. arrived at Philadelphia, the <lb/>Happy Return, Capt. Ewing, in
                    8 weeks <lb/>from Londonderry, brought 340 passengers in <lb/>good health: Capt.
                    Ewing parted, near the <lb/>Capes of Delaware, with the ship Sally, Capt.
                    <lb/>Miller, with passengers from Londonderry for <lb/>that port also.</p>

                    <lb/>Last Sunday evening Mr. John Garrison, son <lb/>of William Garrison, of
                    Newbury township, in <lb/>this county, was killed by lightning in his own
                    <lb/>house. The lightning struck in at the gable and <lb/>just at the instant
                    that Mr. Garrison was in the <lb/>centre of the floor, walking towards the
                    window; <lb/>his brother was standing within two yards of him <lb/>when he fell,
                    but providentially received not the <lb/>smallest hurt.</p>
                <p>We also learn, that Patrick M'Sherry, of Lit<lb break="no"/>tle's-town, in this
                    county, had two cows killed <lb/>by lightning, the same evening.</p>

                    <lb/>A slight shock of an earthquake was fel tin this <lb/>and the neighhbouring

                    <lb/>About five o'clock this morning, a noise was <lb/>heard that seemed to pass
                    over this city, which is <lb/>thought to have come from a north-westerly
                        direc<lb break="no"/>tion and proceeded to a south-easterly one. The
                    <lb/>noise was equal to loud heavy thunder, and the <lb/>commotion occasioned by
                    it very sensible in the <lb/>shaking of houses, but no damage was done.&#x2013;
                    <lb/>The Tuesday preceding, about six or seven miles <lb/>to the southward of
                    this place, a similar but hea<lb break="no"/>vier noise was heard, attended with
                    the like com<lb break="no"/>motion.</p>

                    prospects which continue to di<lb break="no"/>tinguish our public affairs. The

                    progress of the public credit is witnessed by <lb/>a considerable rise of
                    American stock abroad, as <lb/>well as at home; and the revenues allotted for
                    <lb/>this and other national purposes, have been pro<lb break="no"/>ductive
                    beyond the calculation by which they were <lb/> regulated. This latter
                    circumstance is the more <lb/>pleasing, as it is not only a proof the fertility
                    of <lb/>our resources, but as it assures us of a further in<lb break="no"
                    />crease of the national respectability and credit; <lb/>and let me add, as it
                    bears an honourable testi<lb break="no"/>mony to the patriotism and integrity of
                    the ma<lb break="no"/>rine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the

                    />lars as may be requisite for more precise infor<lb break="no"/>mation.</p>
                <p>"Since your last sessions, I have received commu<lb break="no"/>nication, by
                    which it appears, that the district <lb/>of Kentucke, at present a part of
                    Virginia, has <lb/>concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that
                    state, in consequence of which the dis<lb break="no"/>trict is to become a

                    Congress be <lb/>added. For this sanction application is now made. <lb/> I shall
                    cause the papers on this very important <lb/>transaction to be laid before you.
                    The liberality <lb/>and harmony with which it has been conducted, <lb/>will be
                    found to do great honour to both the par<lb break="no"/><cb/>
                    <lb/>ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of <lb/>the Union and its

                    which you will declare on the case sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to you.</p>
                <p>"It has been heretofore known to Congress <lb/>that frequent incursions have been
                    made on our <lb/>frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians <lb/>from
                    the north west side of the Ohio. These, <lb/>with some of the tribes dwelling on
                    and near the <lb/>Wabash, have of late been particularly active in <lb/>their
                    depredations; and, being emboldened by <lb/>the impunity of their crimes, and
                    aided by such <lb/>parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be se<lb break="no"
                    />duced to join in their hostilities, or afford them <lb/>a retreat for their
                    prisoners, and plunder, they <lb/>have, instead of listening to the humane
                        invitati<lb break="no"/>ons and overtures made on the part of the Unit<lb
                        break="no"/>ed States, renewed their violence with fresh ala<lb break="no"
                    />crity and greater effect&#x2013;The lives of a number of <lb/>valuable
                    citizens have thus been sacrificed, and <lb/>some of them under circumstances
                    peculiarly <lb/>shocking, whilst others have been carried into a <lb/>deplorable
                    captivity.</p>
                <p>"These aggravated provocations rendered it es<lb break="no"/>sential to the
                    safety of the western settlements, <lb/>that the aggressors should be made
                    sensible that the <lb/>government of the Union is not less capable of
                    <lb/>punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to <lb/>respect their rights
                    and rewards their attachments. <lb/>As this object could not be effected by
                    defensive <lb/>measures, it became necessary to put in force the <lb/>act which
                    empowers the President to call out the <lb/>militia for the protection of the
                    frontiers; and <lb/>I have accordingly authorised an expedition, in <lb/>which
                    the regular troops in that quarter are com<lb break="no"/>bined with such drafts
                    of militia as were sufficient. <lb/>The event of the measure is yet unknown to
                    me, <lb/>The Secretary at War is directed to lay before <lb/>you a statement of
                    the information on which it <lb/>is founded, as well as an estimate of the
                    expence <lb/>with which it will be attended.</p>
                <p>The disturbed situation of Europe, and parti<lb break="no"/>cularly the critical
                    posture of the great maritime <lb/>powers, whilst it ought to make us more
                        thank<lb break="no"/>ful for the general peace and security enjoyed by
                    <lb/>the United States, reminds us at the same time <lb/>of the circumspection
                    with which it becomes us <lb/>to preserve these blessings. It requires also that
                    <lb/>we should not overlook the tendency of a war, <lb/>and even of preparations
                    for war among the na<lb break="no"/>tions most concerned in active commerce with
                    <lb/>this country, to abridge in means, and there <lb/>by enhance the prince of

                        break="no"/>mend it to your serious reflections, how far and <lb/>in what
                    mode it may be expedient to guard a<lb break="no"/>gainst embarrassments from
                    these contingencies, <lb/>by such encouragements to ur own navigation <lb/>as

                <p>"The laws you have already passed for the esta<lb break="no"/>blishment of a

                <p>"The patronage of our commerce, of our <lb/>merchants and seamen, has called for

                    <lb/>The Consular Convention too, with his most <lb/>Christian Majesty, has

                <p><pb n="6"/> The following, it is said, are the authentic <lb/>particulars of
                    General St Clair's expedition in <lb/>America. The Miamis Indians had been for a
                    <lb/>long time extremely troublesome to the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans, and it
                    was determined to drive them to the <lb/>back country. General St. Clair
                    completely ac<lb break="no"/>complished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a
                    <lb/>detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the In<lb break="no"/>dians on the
                    River St. Joseph, where a severe <lb/>battle was fought. Many Indians were
                    killed, <lb/>but the Americans lost the field; several Officers, <lb/>and 150
                    men were killed, and they were not able <lb/>even to bring off their wounded.
                    This success <lb/>will in all probability give the Indians new cou<lb break="no"
                    />rage, and induce them again to make head a<lb break="no"/>gainst the American
                    army.</p>

                <p>A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th <lb/>ult. informs the public of that

                    <lb/>the next congress, stating arguments in favour of <lb/><hi rend="italic"

                    to the friends <lb/>in Great Britain, Ireland and America. It is <lb/>remarkable
                    that in the re-publication of this epis<lb break="no"/>stle in the Carolina

                    vessel brought <lb/>in a large number of Irish emigrants, some of <lb/>them

                    The vast tracts <lb/>of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw <lb/>river
                    are rapidly rising in value, and nothing is <lb/>wanting here (to compensate for

                    <lb/>"There are two articles produced in the great<lb break="no"/>est abundance
                    on different parts adjoining James <lb/>river, the exportations of which, in the
                    opinion of <lb/>rational men, ought to be considered as of the <lb/>greatest
                    importance to this state. These articles <lb/>are coals, and clays for the
                    several colours of paint, <lb/>which may be had in any quantity, and may be
                    <lb/>afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, <lb/>from every discovery
                    we have been able to make, <lb/>are inexhaustible; all the samples, however,

                    will be the quality of <lb/>the coal. When once a company can be est<lb

                    there is no doubt but that we can supply <lb/>the different capital of the

                    much a more moderate price than that fre<lb break="no"/>quently brought. As to
                    our paints, there are <lb/>none better in the world, and in quantity, when
                    <lb/>manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country <lb/>up the river, of
                    property and enterprize, are be<lb break="no"/>ginning to turn their attention
                    to these branches; <lb/>and with all submissions to our legislature, it is

                <p>I had been with a number of my acquaintance <lb/>taking the diversion of a dance
                    at an inn. The <lb/>fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the <lb/>tavern
                    keeper came in and advised us in a very <lb/>warm manner to make a collection

                    the success of his persuasion, <lb/>went for his hat to collect what we were
                    willing <lb/>to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it <lb/>into small
                    pieces, which we carefully folded and <lb/>put into our pockets. The tavern
                    keeper goes <lb/>round the room, and we, very gravely, drop our <lb/>paper in
                    his hat. The fiddler returns, and the <lb/>landlord with a cheerful face and an

                    <lb/>of the United States in their redemption of the <lb/>public debt, is
                    dangerous to the rights, and sub<lb break="no"/>versive of the interest of the

                <p>The stone work of the light house, at the en<lb break="no"/>trance of our
                    harbour, is now completed. On <lb/>Tuesday the 9th instant, the last stone was
                    laid <lb/>by Mr. Nichols, of this town, master builder. <lb/>The work is
                    extremely well executed. The light<lb break="no"/>house is now 70 feet high. To
                    this the lanthorn, <lb/>which is to be six feet in diameter, will add about
                    <lb/>15 feet, 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is <lb/>now preparing, and will
                    probably be raised and <lb/>lighted by the first of next month.</p>

                    <lb/>From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about <lb/>four o'clock on Wednesday
                    afternoon, as a boat <lb/>was coming from the East side, a most tremen<lb

                    (besides a small light <cb/>
                    <lb/>waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the <lb/>owner of the waggon,
                    with his wife and three <lb/>children; when the storm came on, the woman
                    <lb/>and children took shelter in the waggon, but it <lb/>continued to blow with
                    such violence that the <lb/>waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body
                    <lb/>having by chance got loose from the carriage, <lb/>and being pretty tight,
                    floated some distance <lb/>till its progress was stopped by a rock; the hus<lb
                        break="no"/>band, viewing the melancholy situations of his <lb/>wife and
                    children, resolved to relieve or perish <lb/>with them, and quitting the boat
                    swam to the <lb/>waggon, cut open the cover with his knife, and <lb/> with
                    difficulty kept their heads above water till <lb/>they were relieved by a boat
                    from the West side; <lb/>by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappear<lb
                        break="no"/>ed; the Clergyman just as he found the boat <lb/>sinking mounted
                    his horse, one of the boatmen <lb/>mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by
                    <lb/>this means preserved themselves till they were <lb/>relieved by a boat; the

                    <lb/>swimming got up an oar, but it is thought <lb/>he is drowned, as he has not
                    since been heard <lb/>of; the boat was found in the falls, and one of <lb/>the
                    waggon horses that had been given up for <lb/>lost, was found next day some
                    distance below the <lb/>falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear
                    <lb/>to have received the least injury.</p>

                    Saturday evening, <lb/>and though a number of witnesses clearly proved <lb/>the

                <p><pb n="2"/> The brig Virginia Planter, James Merrifield, <lb/>Master, arrived at
                    Liverpool, brings information <lb/>that on the 5th of May, General Wayne, with
                    <lb/>two thousand provincials, had attacked to<lb break="no"/>tally destroyed
                    most of the Indian towns at the <lb/>back of Georgia, for near two hundred miles
                        a<lb break="no"/>round the river. That M'Gilvray, and his ar<lb break="no"
                    />my of savages, after an unsuccessful and bloody <lb/>engagement, had fled to
                    the woods, where the <lb/>General left them, and returned to Savannah.&#x2013;
                    <lb/>This expedition was undertaken about the begin<lb break="no"/>ning of
                    March, winch has been crowned with the <lb/>expected catastrophe, and though the
                    Cherokee, <lb/>Miami, and Chiquesaw tribes, may mediate re<lb break="no"/>venge
                    at some future period; it is not likely they <lb/>will be in a condition to
                    disturb the settlers for <lb/>some years to come.</p>

                <p>By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn, that <lb/>the people are in quietness,
                    but still armed; and <lb/>that the Governor, who had been suffered to re<lb
                        break="no"/>main, but the Intendent only having fled, is per<lb break="no"
                    />fectly submissive to the will of the people.</p>
                <p>For several days last week the weather at the <lb/>north side, and in some of the
                    Liguanea Moun<lb break="no"/>tains blew in most alarming gusts, and the cold
                    <lb/>is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plan<lb break="no"/>tain trees
                    have been thrown down, but we have <lb/>yet heard of no material damage.</p>
                <p>The sloop Resolution has brought into port a <lb/>part of his Majesty's 10th
                    regiment of foot, con<lb break="no"/>sisting of a serjeant, and 29 privates,
                    having re<lb break="no"/>ceived them from on board the ship Commerce, <lb/>Foot,
                    from London, off the East End on Thurs<lb break="no"/>day last, the Commerce

                    Spanish American coast. <lb/>The Amphion was bound to Carthagena, but was
                    <lb/>prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from <lb/>entering that port.
                    Accounts are said to be re<lb break="no"/>ceived by her that a revolt has taken
                    place a<lb break="no"/>mongst the Indians in that quarter, and that the

                    which it has cost them <lb/>so much labour and expence to raise; so appre<lb

                <p>We learn from Georgia, that the treaty with <lb/>the Indians, to negotiate with
                    Commissioners <lb/>were appointed by the President of the United <lb/>States,
                    has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gil<lb break="no"/>livray and his warriors
                    have declared, that nothing <lb/>short of a cession of the territory between the

                    that no equivalent can be given to the <lb/>Georgians for relinquishing their
                    claim to the di<lb break="no"/>strict in question, as it is founded in
                    usurpation. <lb/>The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this re<lb break="no"

                    establish a sea-port at St Mary's, as well <lb/>for thecommercial emolument, as
                    for the civili<lb break="no"/>zation of his countrymen, by an intercourse with

                        e<lb break="no"/>equal proportion to those who served for a shorter period;
                    <lb/>and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real <lb/>value, to the
                    injury of the Patriotic Veteran, as has <lb/>been the case of former grants, he
                    is allowed his option <lb/>of taking its value in sterling money, at the present
                    <lb/>market price, from the Treasure of the States; or any <lb/>part in land,
                    and the rest in money,a s may be most <lb/>agreeable to the receiver.</p>
                <p>The Mint of the United States, which was establish<lb break="no"/>ed two years
                    since, has begun to issue its hold and silver <lb/>coin: the copper has been
                    delivered some time. The <lb/>gold coins are eagles, half eagles, and quarter
                    eagles.</p>
                <p>The first is exactly five and forty shillings, English <lb/>money, or ten
                    American coin.</p>
                <p>The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half, <lb/>and quater, which
                    makes the courie of exchange simple, <lb/>and suits the reckoning to a very
                    capacity&#x2013;as our Read<lb break="no"/>ers will perceive, that ten quarter
                    dollars make the quar<lb break="no"/>ter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle;
                    and ten dol<lb break="no"/>lars the eagle.</p>
                <p>There is, besides, one more silver coin, which is cal<lb break="no"/>led a Dime,
                    and is the tenth part of a dollar.</p>
                <p>The copper coin is called a Cent, and is the tenth <lb/>part of a Dime.</p>
                <p>Six of the ships of war, which were voted by Con<lb break="no"/>gress in November
                    last, are completed and put in com<lb break="no"/>mission: the remaining twenty
                    four will be ready by <lb/>Midsummer next, and will complete a fleet of
                        <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>
                    <lb/>hundred guns.</p>
                <p>The city of Washington, which in five years more <lb/>will be the Capital of the
                    United States, will in every <lb/>respect be the first in the world: the Capitol
                    or Con<lb break="no"/>gress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence, and
                        <lb/>c<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> a full and complete view
                    of every part of <lb/>the city, as well as a considerable extent of the country
                    <lb/>around. The President's house likewise stands upon a <lb/>rising ground
                    near the banks of the Potamac, possessing <lb/>a delightful water prospect,
                    together with a commanding <lb/>view of the Capitol and some other material
                    parts of the <lb/>city.</p>
                <p>From the President's house to the Capitol, run two <lb/>great pleasure parks or
                    malls, which intersect and ter<lb break="no"/>minate upon the banks of the
                    Potomac, and are orna<lb break="no"/>mented at the sides by elegant buildings
                    for Foreign Mi<lb break="no"/>nisters. The four fronts of the Capitol, as well
                    as those <lb/>of the President's house, are of the finest marble. The
                    <lb/>building of these superb edifices has been much retarded <lb/>by the want
                    of stone cutters, masons, bricklayers, car<lb break="no"/>penters, and
                    blacksmiths, who at this time actually re<lb break="no"/>ceive the enormous
                    wages of ten shillings American <lb/>currency per day.</p>
                <p>The district of Country at the back of North Caro<lb break="no"/>lina, reaching
                    to the Mississippi, and covering a country <lb/>six hundred miles long by three
                    hundred broad, is next <lb/>winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the
                    <lb/>Province of Maine, extending from the borders of New <lb/>Hampshire to the
                    river St. Croix, is expected to form a <lb/>Seventeenth.</p>
                <p>The new cities build in America since her indepen<lb break="no"/>dence are
                    Grenville, in the State of Georgia; Marten<lb break="no"/>berg, the Capitol of
                    North Carolina; Columbia, the <lb/>Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and
                    Nashville, in <lb/>the Tenesee Settlements; Danville, Fairfield, and Lex<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ington, in the State of Kentucky; Washington, the <lb/>Capital of the
                    United States; Sunbury, in the State of <lb/>Pennsylvania; Hudson, upon Husdon's
                    River, and Coo<lb break="no"/>per's Town, in the State of New York; Bennington,
                    in <lb/>the State of Vermont; and Paterson, in the State of <lb/>New Jersey. All
                    the towns burnt by the English in the <lb/>was, have been rebuilt, and the old
                    cities of Charlestown, <lb/>Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, have
                    <lb/>been extended to more than double the extent they had <lb/>before the
                    peace.</p>
                <p>The population of the United States, by the last Cen<lb break="no"/>sus in 1790,
                    was more than double what it was in 1775, <lb/>by which it appears, that America
                    doubles her number <lb/>of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from
                    <lb/>the different nations in Europe to that country, are esi<lb break="no"
                    />mated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The <lb/>increase of farms
                    and villages has been so great as to <lb/>people four new States, and to extend
                    their Settlements <lb/>from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South, and from
                    <lb/>the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in <lb/>the North.</p>

                <p><pb n="6"/>Letters from Alexandria, in Virginia, dated <lb/>the 9th May last,
                    mention, that General Wayne <lb/>had been dispatched, in the beginning of March,
                    <lb/>on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis <lb/>and Chickesau Indians,
                    who have, for some time <lb/>past, had as their chief warrior, one Macgillivray,
                    <lb/>a Scotchman, who has long resided among these <lb/>Indians. General Wayne,
                    at the head of two <lb/>thousand Provincials, had completely routed them
                    <lb/>after a great slaughter. After the battle, Mac<lb break="no"/>gillivray and
                    his savages took refuge in the woods. <lb/>General Wayne has destroyed the most
                    part of <lb/>the habitation of these Indians in the extent of <lb/>200 English
                    miles along the river, which is the <lb/>boundary of Georgia, after which he
                    returned to <lb/>Savannah. This defeat is so total, that it will put <lb/>it out
                    of the power of these Indians to be again <lb/>troublesome to the State of
                    Virginia.</p>

                <p><pb n="3"/>The American States having now gained their <lb/>independence, have no
                    cause of quarrel let with <lb/>this country; but matters are very different
                        be<lb break="no"/>tween them and Spain. It is well known, that <lb/>the
                    Indians on the back settlements have been <lb/>regularly supplied with arms and
                    ammunition <cb/>
                    <lb/>from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, <lb/>to enable them to
                    distress the Americans, and <lb/>prove at least a hindrance to their growing
                        pro<lb break="no"/>sperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi <lb/>has
                    been denied them?and the Spaniards, now <lb/>in possession of the Floridas, have
                    been continual<lb break="no"/>ly quarrelling with them about their
                    boundaries.</p>
                <p>It may therefore be considered as almost cer<lb break="no"/>tain, that the
                    American states will take an active <lb/>part against Spain. This will be a
                    great acquisi<lb break="no"/>tion to Britain in every point of view; for though
                    <lb/>American cannot furnish money, she can furnish <lb/>men and provisions; and
                    afree intercourse with <lb/>her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the
                    <lb/>security of our West-India Islands. Their pri<lb break="no"/>vateers, too,
                    will be able to take their runs so <lb/>speedily, that the Spanish trade must be
                    very <lb/>materially injured thereby.</p>

                </p>
                <p>By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. <lb/>we learn, that the small-pox
                    raged lately at >Su<lb break="no"/>rinam, to such a degree that, within the
                    space of <lb/>two months, upwards of 2500 persons had perish<lb break="no"/>ed
                    by that disorder.</p>
                <p>A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt <lb/>between give and six on the
                    evening of last Thurs<lb break="no"/>day se'ennight, at the settlements near the
                    Blue <lb/>Mountains.</p>
                <p>On Wednesday the 3d instant, arrived at Luc<lb break="no"/>ca, the ship Pitt,
                    Captain Hunter, from Africa <lb/>with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage
                    <lb/>from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom <lb/>Captain Hunter has
                    brought confined in irons, <lb/>and they are to be tried at a Court of
                        Admiral<lb break="no"/>ty Sessions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Feb</hi>. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertain<lb
                        break="no"/>ed by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' <lb/>Gilveray, and
                    the nations under his immediate <lb/>controul, or in alliance with him, are
                    subsidied <lb/>by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, <lb/>that they are
                    regularly supplied with cloathing, <lb/>arms and ammunition, from the Royal
                        Maga<lb break="no"/>zines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and there<lb
                        break="no"/>fore in all probability; the sword not the olive <lb/>branch,
                    will be the most speedy and effectual <lb/>agent for terminating the

                <p>Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of <lb/>the settlement at the Bay of
                    Honduras, in the <lb/>room of Colonel Despard, recalled.</p>
                <p>Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effing<lb break="no"/>ham; it is therefore
                    probable that the dis<lb break="no"/>putes which have so long subsisted between
                        Lieu<lb break="no"/>tenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of <lb/>the
                    Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy <lb/>determination.</p>
                <p>At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's e<lb break="no"/>state,a negro
                    blacksmith was sold for the extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary sum of two hundred and
                    sixty pounds!</p>
                <p>At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d <lb/>regiment quitted the barracks in
                    this town and <lb/>at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the <lb/>Chichester
                    for Great Britain; the 14th at the <lb/>same time taking possession of their
                    quarters.</p>
                <p>Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispani<lb break="no"/>ola, that, on the
                    1st of this month, a number of <lb/>free people of colour, to the amount of 700
                    and <lb/>upwards, having possessed themselves of several <lb/>field pieces,
                    formed a camp in that districh, and <lb/>exhibited an appearance of hostility
                    highly alarm<lb break="no"/>ing. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent
                    <lb/>from the Assembly to demand the reason of so <lb/>extraordinary a
                    proceeding, the insurgents de<lb break="no"/>manded, that a remonstrance which
                    they then <lb/>delivered to the deputies, should be presented im<lb break="no"
                    />immediately to the general, and that an answer <lb/>thereto should be given
                    without delay. The pa<lb break="no"/>per being conveyed as they desired, proved
                    to be <lb/>a sensible and well written detail of the various <lb/>claims the
                    free people of colour had on what they <lb/>termed the justice of the whites,
                    with whom they <lb/>demanded an equal participation of all rights and <pb n="3"
                    /> immunities whatsoever&#x2013;the privilege of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation,
                    and of qualifying for all the learned <lb/>professions&#x2013;and concluding
                    with the avowal of <lb/>a determination to proceed to extremities should
                    <lb/>their demands be treat with neglect.</p>
                <p>On the perusal of this paper, it was judged ad<lb break="no"/>viseable to
                    assemble a body of the militia, who <lb/>headed by the General, immediately went
                    against <lb/>the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired <lb/>and fled to
                    the mountains; three or four of the <lb/>whites were killed, and one of the
                    ringleaders was <lb/>taken and instantly beheaded.</p>
                <p>A proclamation was then issued, offering a re<lb break="no"/>ward of 50 half joes
                    for the head of any principal <lb/>offender, and in the course of a few days not
                    less <lb/>than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday <lb/>the 7th instant, a
                    very great majority of those <lb/>who had formed the camp, finding all their
                        at<lb break="no"/>tempts completely frustrated, came in and took <lb/>the
                    oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two <lb/>of the principals, for whom
                    high rewards are of<lb break="no"/>fered, are not yet taken.</p>
                <p>From Port Maria we have received the disagree<lb break="no"/>able account of the
                    loss of the ship Lion, Capt. <lb/>Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent
                    breeze <lb/>on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, <lb/>and she now lies
                    stranded on the beach.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The circumstances of thetrade and situation <lb/>of this part of North America
                    being a matter of <lb/>such general conversation and great public mo<lb
                        break="no"/>ment, we are particularly happy in being enabled <lb/>to give
                    some further account of the transactions, <lb/>that have happened at Nootka
                    Sounds, as well as <lb/>to point out the advantages that were likely to <lb/>be
                    extended to other places by the means of this <lb/>trade.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to remark that the skin of the <lb/>sea otter is worn only in the
                    Northern regions of <lb/>China. Its fur, though beautiful and magnifi<lb
                        break="no"/>cent, is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of <lb/>the
                    Southern Provinces.</p>
                <p>Pekin is, therefore, the proper mart for this <lb/>valuable commodity, and in
                    this immense city, <lb/>the consumption is so great, that the produce of
                    <lb/>the voyage meets and immediate sale.</p>
                <p>The Mandarins of the Court, and even the <lb/>Emperor himself, are fond of
                    wearing this costly <lb/>fur. To a citizen of common rank, a sea otter's
                    <lb/>collar to his vestment is a luxury.</p>
                <p>The natives of the North West Coast of Ame<lb break="no"/>erica set so great a
                    value on woollens of all kinds, <lb/>that all the blankets, cloths, hats, and
                    stockings, <lb/>that could be procured in China, if English ma<lb break="no"
                    />nufacture, weresold to the Indians, with whose <lb/>Chiefs treaties of
                    commerce had been formed.</p>
                <p>An act of cruelty committed by an officer of <lb/>the Spanish Admiral Martiney's
                    ship deserves to <lb/>be recorded.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards discovering that Callicum, a <lb/>Chief, second in authority at
                    Nootka Sound, was <lb/>in alliance with the English, he was shot through
                    <lb/>the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife <lb/>of Callicum, with an
                    infant child, escaped, but <lb/>not till wounded.</p>
                <p>Macquilla, the Chief, first in command, re<lb break="no"/>tired at the head of
                    the allies of England, from <lb/>Nootka Sound, and to avoid the cruelty of the
                    <lb/>Spaniards, they fled to distant parts. Such of <lb/>the natives as they
                    could seize, the Spaniards <lb/>condemned to work as slaves on their
                        fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions.</p>
                <p>At this period it was in the contemplation of <lb/>the Spaniards to seize the
                    Sandwich Islands, with <lb/>a view to deprive British ships of refreshments.
                    <lb/>And we further add, on authority that amounts <lb/>nearly to demonstration,
                    that on the very lands <lb/>purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain
                    <lb/>Mears, the Spaniards have already opened valuable <lb/>mines.</p>
                <p>Another object of this enterprise wasto sup<lb break="no"/>ply the markets of
                    Kamschatka, and other ports <lb/>belonging to the Russians, with the teas and
                    other <lb/>produce of China. This promised to be an in<lb break="no"/>valuable
                    channel of commerce, as the Chinese <lb/>have shut their ports against the
                    Russians, who <lb/></p>
                <p>On this voyage of discovery and experiment, <lb/>one of our ships sailed and
                    disposed of her cargo, <lb/>but was unfortunately lost on her return to
                    China.</p>
                <p>To these curious particulars we add, with a <lb/>patriot joy, that the
                    consumption of the glorious <lb/>staple of England, her broad cloths, is
                        astonish<lb break="no"/>ingly great in Japan and China: British hard<lb
                        break="no"/>
                    <lb/>ware, &amp;c. is also in great request.</p>
                <p>From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears, <lb/>ships which touch at the
                    Sandwich islands may <lb/>depend on the utmost attention and civility. <lb/>This
                    Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high, of propor<lb break="no"/>tionate bulk.

                        Member of the General Assembly, dated, <lb/>Nov</hi>. 7, 1790.</p>
                <p>"I have been waiting with much impatience <lb/>to obtain some certain account of
                    our troops; <lb/>many probably conjectures still fill the minds of the
                    <lb/>people. A hand-bill just come to Bourbon, con<lb break="no"/>tains an
                    extract of a letter from Governor St. <cb/>
                    <lb/>Clair to General Wilkinson, which mentions that <lb/>our army had met with
                    but little opposition. The <lb/>Miami villages were abandoned, from thence a
                    <lb/>detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river, <lb/>which fell in with a
                    party of Indians, and had a <lb/>severe engagement.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar made a shew of retreating, <lb/>and marched about eight miles,
                    when he detached <lb/>a strong party to the field of action, in hopes of
                    <lb/>finding the Indians on the ground; as they ex<lb break="no"/>pected, so
                    they found them, and an action imme<lb break="no"/>diately commenced, which was
                    obstinate on both <lb/>sides.</p>
                <p>"A vast number of Indians were killed in <lb/>crossing the St. Joseph's river.
                    Major Fountain, <lb/>of Fayette, and General Scott's son were killed <lb/>the
                    second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militia<lb break="no"/>men were killed; Major
                    Willis, Lieut. Fother<lb break="no"/>ingham, of the F&#x2013;deral troops, and
                    77 privates, <lb/>also fell in the action.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar did not send a single man <lb/>to reinforce the detachment,
                    consisting of 400 <lb/>men, (who had to sustain the fire of the whole
                    <lb/>Indian army) although he had with him in camp <lb/>upwards of 1100 men. Our
                    men at last lost <lb/>ground, Colonel Harding's wing was beaten, and
                    <lb/>finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall, of Bour<lb break="no"/>bon, and
                    Majors M'Million and Willis broke the <lb/>other wing of the Indians, which
                    occasioned the <lb/>amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph.</p>
                <p>"General Harmar never sent to bring off the <lb/>wounded, nor bury the dead.
                    Captain David <lb/>Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The <lb/>Bourbon
                    militia has suffered very much, nearly <lb/>one third of them having fallen on
                    the spot.</p>
                <p>"The army is now at Licking, and is ex<lb break="no"/>pected home hourly.</p>
                <p>"This is the best account that I have been <lb/>able to collect; it will be
                    delivered to you by <lb/>Major Jones, who before he leaves the district,
                    <lb/>may be enabled to obtain further particulars."</p>

                    <lb/>Intelligence has been received, that in some <lb/>trivial dispute with a
                    native Indian, a Spaniard <lb/>has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto, and
                    <lb/>then fled. The nation to whom the Indian be<lb break="no"/>longed, being
                    made acquainted with the murder, <lb/>sent a deputation to the Governor,
                    demanding <lb/>that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered <lb/>up as an
                    attonement. This was peremptorily re<lb break="no"/>fused, as being more than
                    commensurate to the <lb/>offence, but the murderer was offered as a satis<lb
                        break="no"/>faction; the Indians would not accept him singly, <lb/>and
                    departed, vowing the severest revenge: a <lb/>few days afterwards intelligence
                    was received that <lb/>they had surprised and massacred sixteen men, <lb/>who
                    had been at work in the woods; and when <lb/>the vessel departed, the Spaniards
                    were flying, <lb/>with the utmost precipitation and terror, from <lb/>all parts
                    of the country, seeking shelter in the <lb/>forts.</p>

                    lying to in a heavy gale <lb/>of wind, the Albion shipped a sea, which carried
                    <lb/>away all her boats and every loose article from <lb/>the deck; there were

                <p>"I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place <lb/>we left the 3d. inst. in company
                    with two other <lb/>boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without <lb/>meeting or
                    apprehending danger&#x2013;at that place <lb/>we were informed of several
                    disasters which had <lb/>befallen boats going down the river, and one to <lb/>a
                    boat going up to a French station, loaded with <lb/>bacon, butter, &amp;c. The
                    particulars relative to <lb/>the latter are as follow&#x2013;The boat was
                    attacked <lb/>by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that <lb/>were on
                    shore as a guard were fired on by them. <lb/>&#x2013;Immediately after firing,
                    they gave the Indian <lb/>whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them
                    <lb/>every one (about 22)&#x2013; they then fired at the <lb/>boat, but did no
                    damage, as it required some <lb/>time to make their way into the river. After
                    <lb/>the savages had executed this terrible act of bar<lb break="no"/>barity,
                    they continued on the river watching for <lb/>other boats. In the course of
                    about six days, five <lb/>or six boats happened to come down the
                    river&#x2013;the <lb/>savages attacked the foremost of them, in which <lb/>were
                    two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, <lb/>a young gentleman, and some
                    others, passengers, <lb/>and took it. Elevated with this easy capture, <lb/>they
                    imagined themselves capable of taking every <lb/>boat they might fall in
                    with&#x2013;In a little time a <lb/>second boat hove in fight, which they
                    attacked <lb/>with great fury&#x2013;they were in three canoes, each <lb/>canoe
                    containing about twenty&#x2013;they moved to<lb break="no"/>wards the boat, as
                    it came down, and commenced <lb/>firing; after discharging their guns, they
                        retreat<lb break="no"/>ed, loading and came on a second time, fired and
                    <lb/>repeated nine different times; as often as they <lb/>come on, there was a
                    brisk firing kept up from <lb/>the boat, which contained nine fighting
                    men;&#x2013; <lb/>during the conflict two were killed, and five <lb/>wounded;
                    two only remained to protect the boat, <lb/>and prevent the Indians from
                    boarding it, which <lb/>every appearance of their conduct plainly indi<lb

                    supposed, their <lb/>ammunition being expended, they retreated, <lb/>without
                    accomplishing their object.</p>
                <p>"These inhuman monsters, previous to their <lb/>attacking the last mentioned
                    boat, placed the <lb/>two young ladies in front of their canoes, <lb/>in which
                    situation they were both killed. A few <lb/>days after this transaction, they
                    fired at another <lb/>boat, and killed one young man. In short, every <lb/>boat
                    tat has gone down the river lately, has <lb/>been fired at, except our's. We saw
                    no Indians; <lb/>the places where the above depredation happen<lb break="no"/>ed

                </p>
                <p>Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, <lb/>the ship Termagant, belonging
                    to the house of <lb/>Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite <lb/>this
                    town, was discovered on fire. The inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of the town and
                    the seamen in the harbour <lb/>speedily collected, but on account of a quantity
                    <lb/>of powder that was on board, the efforts that o<lb break="no"/>therwise
                    would have been exerted to extinguish <lb/>the flames were withholden. The first
                    soon com<lb break="no"/>municated itself to the powder; and the explosion
                    <lb/>was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the <lb/>houses in the town. The
                    cinders and pieces of <lb/>the ship were flying in every direction, and it
                    <lb/>and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, <lb/>store and
                    dwelling houses, on the water side, were <lb/>prevented from sharing a similar
                    fate with the <lb/>ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, <lb/>the
                    property of Francis and Charles Loundes, si<lb break="no"/>tuated at some
                    distance from the water, wherein <lb/>upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were
                        stor<lb break="no"/>ed, was several times, in different places, on fire,
                    <lb/>ut happily extinguished without sustaining much <lb/>damage. The loss,
                    occasioned by this alarming <lb/>element, must be great indeed, as the ship was
                    <lb/>large and nearly new; besides, there were goods <lb/>to a considerable
                    amount, and a pretty large sum <lb/>of money on board of her: all of which
                        (except<lb break="no"/>ing a part of the money, which has since been
                    <lb/>found) was destroyed. We are informed that <lb/>this accident proceeded
                    from the steward's falling <lb/>to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the
                        cab<lb break="no"/>bin, which by some means or other, set fire to <lb/>the
                    sails that were stowed there. It had got far <lb/>advanced before it was
                    discovered. Providenti<lb break="no"/>ally no lives were lost.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pittsburgh, May</hi> 21. A letter received in this <lb/>town,
                    on Sunday last, from Lieut. Jeffers, at <lb/>Fort Franklin, mentions, that an
                    Indian had ar<lb break="no"/>rived there, who brought him intelligence that
                    <lb/>300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations <lb/>had set out for war and
                    that they were determin<lb break="no"/>ed to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio,
                    near Pe<lb break="no"/>tersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing, but <lb/>their
                    destination was not known.</p>

                <p><pb n="6"/> By private letters and newspapers lately arrived <lb/>from
                    Philadelphia and New York we have inform<lb break="no"/>mation, that the Indians
                    are carrying on their de<lb break="no"/>predations on the back settlements of
                    the United <lb/>States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to <lb/>the
                    miscarriage of the war had been made by <lb/>Congress, and an army was collected
                    this year; <lb/>that the Americans had some expectations of get<lb break="no"
                    />ting free of the Indian war by treaties.</p>
                <p>We have advices of Governor Clinton's being <lb/>re-elected Governor of New York
                    state by a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 180, but the friends of Mr. Tay were
                    <lb/>objecting to the return, as the canvassers had not <lb/>opened the boxes
                    which contained the returns <lb/>from three counties, Otsego, Clinton, and
                    Tioga, <lb/>which if opened they say would have given the <lb/>election to Mr.
                    Tay, the county of Otsego alone <lb/>being 300 majority in favours of Mr.
                    Tay.</p>
                <p>A dreadful storm happened at New York on <lb/>the 1st of July, which continued
                    with so much <lb/>violence, that several vessels were driven from their
                    <lb/>moorings, and a number of boats upset and many <lb/>lives lost.</p>

                <p>The attack was commenced on the morning of <lb/>the 28th of June, by a company of

                    <lb/>"On Saturday the 1st of July, I left Tioga point, <lb/>near the middle of
                    the day; about half after one <lb/>o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising
                    from <lb/>the north west, and I had scarcely time to take <lb/>shelter in the
                    house of Obadiah Gore, Esq; at <lb/>Sheshequen, before the storm came on,
                    attended <lb/>with heavy thunder and lightening, and a violent <lb/>gale of wind
                    with rain. The storm continued up<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>wards of half an hour, during which time to see <lb/>the tumbling of timber
                    during the storm, was sur<lb break="no"/>prising. After it abated I continued on
                    my jour<lb break="no"/>ney, but found it very difficult travelling in many
                    <lb/>places, the road being blocked up by the falling <lb/>of timber. I reached
                    Wilksbarree on Wednesday. <lb/>It appears that the storm extended through the
                    <lb/>country, and at the same hour of the day, blew <lb/>more violent in some
                    places than others. At Exe<lb break="no"/>eter, about nine miles from
                    Wilksbarrie, a level <lb/>plain loaded with pitch pine timber, was swept of
                    <lb/>its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile <lb/>in length, and
                    three fourths of a mile wide, being <lb/>either torn up by the roots or twisted
                    off, leaving <lb/>their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.</p>
                <p>"A number of buildings in different parts of <lb/>the country stript of their
                    roofs, and otherways <lb/>damaged&#x2013;fences in many place removed, and
                    <lb/>many fields of corn, others grain and flax laid level <lb/>with the
                    earth&#x2013;cattle killed by the falling of tim<lb break="no"/>ber in every
                    part of the country.</p>
                <p>"A Mr. &#x2013;Lot, who lived at Mahooper, <lb/>about 35 miles from Wilksbarre,
                    whose family <lb/>consisted of his wife and a number of children&#x2013; <lb/>he
                    with his wife being absent children seeing them<lb break="no"/>selves in danger
                    in the house, left it at the instant <lb/>a large tree was falling; the tree
                    reached them a <lb/>small distance from the door, and a girl about e<lb
                        break="no"/>leven years of age was crushed to pieces about expir<lb
                        break="no"/>ed instantly. One of the other children had a <lb/>thigh and
                    both arms broke, another badly wound<lb break="no"/>ed in the head&#x2013;these
                    two it is feared has received <lb/>the fatal blow, two other slightly
                    wounded."</p>

                <p>"By accounts from Kentucky we are inform<lb break="no"/>ed, that about the 1st of
                    this month a party of <lb/>Indians appeared near Frankfort, and took a great

                    to the Ohio; but not fal<lb break="no"/>ling in with them he crossed the river,
                    leaving 100 <lb/>men to take care of his horses; after marching <lb/>about 12 or
                    15 miles, overtook a large party, when <lb/>a severe engagement ensued, but
                    being overpower<lb break="no"/>ed by numbers, was obliged to retreat. He then
                    <lb/>sent for the men left behind, and came up with <lb/>the Indians the next
                    day, and after engaging some <lb/>time, obliged them to make a precipitate
                    retreat. <lb/>Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors, two <lb/>Englishmen and a
                    Frenchman from Detroit, and <lb/>all the negroes and horses."</p>

                <p><pb n="2"/> Each day brings additional strength to the re<lb break="no"/>port of
                    a rupture with America. The represen<lb break="no"/>tations which have been very
                    forcibly urged by the <lb/>American Minister, Mr. Pinckney, include various
                    <lb/>topics of complaint. Amongst these are, the with<lb break="no"/>holding of
                    the poste of Niagara, Detroit, &amp;c. in <lb/>violation of the treaty of 1783;
                    the exciting of <lb/>the Creek and other Indians to make war upon the
                    <lb/>American frontier; the refusal to make compen<lb break="no"/>sation for the
                    property seized by the armies under <lb/>Lord Cornwallis, &amp;c in the Southern
                    States, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to stipulation; the seizure of American
                    <lb/>ships bound to France; the impressing of Ameri<lb break="no"/>can citizens
                    to man our fleets; and finally, the <lb/>sullen silence which the British
                    Minister is alledg<lb break="no"/>ed to have uniformly maintained on the subject
                    of <lb/>the claims made by the Republic.</p>
                <p>The American Minister has, however, so little <lb/>hope of efficacy from these
                    representations, that <lb/>he has ordered in his tradesman's bills, and made
                    <lb/>every other preparation for an abrupt departure.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this a<supplied reason="copy fade">??</supplied>miny aspect of
                    affairs, <lb/>we still must hope, that no consequences subversive <lb/>of the
                    pacific system at present subsisting between <lb/>America and Great Britain will
                    ensue; for ill<lb break="no"/>judged and ignorant, indeed, of the true interests
                    <lb/>of his country must that Briton be (whatever his <lb/>rank( who would
                    advise another American war <lb/>&#x2013;a war which, reasoning of the future by
                    the <lb/>sorrowful experience of the past, can only serve to <lb/>increase the
                    sum, and to swell the catalogue of <lb/>human woe.</p>

                </p>
                <p>By the Governor Macquarrie, are arrived Cap<lb break="no"/>tain Fowler, and part
                    of the crew of the Indian <lb/>brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in
                    <lb/>August 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent <lb/>and Eastern Islands, and
                    from thence to China, <lb/>but was cut off and plundered, on the night of the
                    <lb/>10th of April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's <lb/>Bay, at the Island
                    of Rooapoah, one of the Mar<lb break="no"/>quesas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five
                    of the <lb/>crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, <lb/>and joining with
                    some of the Rooapoah natives, <lb/>took the opportunity of a dark night, and
                    <lb/>the wind blowing fresh right on the land, <lb/>to cut the vessel adrift, by
                    which means she <lb/>drove on shore through a heavy surf, and was <lb/>soon
                    bilged and filled with water. When the <lb/>cannibal natives saw that it was
                    impracticable to <lb/>get the vessel afloat, they concurred universally <lb/>in
                    the design of putting the whole of her crew <lb/>to death; which appears to have
                    been a constant <lb/>practise among the different natives towards one
                    <lb/>another, when their canoes happen to fall upon <lb/>a strange shore,
                    through stress of weather, or <lb/>from any other accident.</p>
                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with <lb/>their chief, or king, Nooahetu,
                    who presided at <lb/>the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfor<lb
                        break="no"/>tunate mariners to instant slaughter. He with<lb break="no"
                    />held his assent to the murder; but had no hesi<lb break="no"/>tation in
                    permitting the plunder of the vessel&#x2013; <lb/>The crew were informed by such
                    expressions as <lb/>they could understand, as well as by gesticulations
                    <lb/>that accompanied their vehement debate on the <lb/>occasion, that their
                    lives were dependent on the <lb/>issue; the good chief was opposed to many other
                    <lb/>chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in rank, <lb/>were very far superior
                    in number, supported by <lb/>the common usages of the island, from which the
                    <lb/>exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable <lb/>deviation. He was
                    seated, with his son by <lb/>his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been
                    <lb/>called to the supremacy of the island by the gene<lb break="no"/>ral wish
                    of the people, as it was not a hereditary <lb/>right, but an elective dignity.
                    His people press<lb break="no"/>ed their solicitations earnestly, and at length
                    <lb/>peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; <lb/>which he for a
                    length of time opposed by the <lb/>force of words, which not seeming likely to
                        pre<lb break="no"/>vail, he adopted a method which silenced the <lb/>whole
                    in an instant, and saved the lives of Capt. <lb/>Fowler and his crew. Finding
                    that all his ex<lb break="no"/>postulations were defeated, on the principle of
                    <lb/>undeviating custom, he deliberately took up two <lb/>ropes that were near
                    him, and fixing one round <lb/>the neck of his son, and the other round his own,
                    <lb/>called to the chief next in command, who im<lb break="no"/>mediately
                    approached him. His conference was <lb/>short and decisive: he first pointed to
                    the cord <lb/>that encircled the neck of his son, and then to <lb/>the other
                    which he had entwined around his own. <lb/>"These strangers are doomed to
                    death," said he, <lb/>"by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit <lb/>that
                    I, who am their King, should live to see so <lb/>vile a deed perpetrated. Let my
                    child and my<lb break="no"/>self be strangled before it is performed and then
                    <lb/>it never will be said that we sanctioned, even <lb/>with our eye-sight, the
                    destruction of these un<lb break="no"/>offending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not <lb/>do less than produce, even in
                    the mind of the <lb/>unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, <lb/>mingled
                    with a sentiment of admiration in which <lb/>the untaught man may possibly excel
                    his fellow- <lb/>creature, whose conceptions are moulded by te<lb break="no"
                    />nets calculated to guard him from the extremes <lb/>of passion. For a moment
                    the people looked <lb/>wildly upon their king, whose person they ador<lb
                        break="no"/>ed, because that his principles were good, and <lb/>his
                    government just and mild. They saw <lb/>the obedient chief, to whom the order of
                    <lb/>strangulation had been imparted, staring with <lb/>horror and amazement at
                    the change which a <lb/>few moments had produced; The mandate which <lb/>had
                    proceeded from the King's own lips must be <lb/>obeyed; and, commanded to
                    perform the dread<lb break="no"/>ful office, he proceeded to obey when a sudden
                    <lb/>shout from the multitude awed him to forbear<lb break="no"/>ance. "The
                    King! the King!" from every lip <lb/>burst forth&#x2013;'What! kill the King!
                    No, no, let <lb/>all the strangers live&#x2013;no man shall kill the <lb/>King!"
                    Thus were their lives preserved, and <lb/>the vessel plundered of every thing on
                    board <lb/>her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt <lb/>at Noorheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low <lb/>water. All her iron and copper have been taken <lb/>out by
                    the natives, who have a thorough know<lb break="no"/><cb/>
                    <lb/>ledge of the use of these materials. That they <lb/>are cannibals is well
                    ascertained. They form <lb/>distinct factions, and make war upon the ruling
                    <lb/>chief. The rebels are denominated the typees; <lb/>and the opposite parties
                    are horribly sanguinary <lb/>towards each other. Six of the adverse party were
                    <lb/>killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain <lb/>Fowler was among them,
                    and the following de<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>testable circumstance occurred on the occasion: <lb/>A native man belonging
                    to Port Anna Maria, <lb/>who was not tattooed, and in consequence pro<lb
                        break="no"/>hibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain <lb/>of death,
                    impatient of the restraint, fell upon one <lb/>of the murdered bodies, and
                    darting his teeth <lb/>into it in all the madness of a voracious fury,
                    <lb/>exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet <lb/>coagulated.</p>
                <p>The chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very <lb/>friendly to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, <lb/>the first part of the name implying the outrigger <lb/>of a
                    canoe, and the latter signifying great. The <lb/>dress of the men consists
                    merely of a wrapper <lb/>about the waist; the women are covered from the
                    <lb/>shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are ge<lb break="no"/>nerally fairer
                    than the Taheitan women. The <lb/>chiefs have no distinguishing mark or
                    ornament, <lb/>but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the <lb/>common
                    orders wear tied up in a large knot on <lb/>each side of the head, a stripe of
                    which, extend<lb break="no"/>ing from the forehead to the hollow of the neck, is
                    <lb/>kept shorn, which practice the chiefs do not adopt. <lb/>Captain Fowler
                    supposes the worms to be more pre<lb break="no"/>valent and destructive to the
                    ship's bottoms there than <lb/>he has any where else witnessed; and to this
                    cause at<lb break="no"/>tributes the caution of the natives in drawing up
                    <lb/>their largest canoes, some of which contain from <lb/>80 to 100 warriors.
                    They are anxious after eve<lb break="no"/>ry kind of property carried among them
                    for bar<lb break="no"/>ter, and this is supposed their chief inducement <lb/>for
                    attacking vessels, when they can do so with <lb/>a probability of accomplishing
                    their object.&#x2013; <lb/>They have no knowledge of the use of muskets,
                    <lb/>and have none among them except a few at Port <lb/>Anna Maria. A gentleman,
                    at this time in Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, who resided among them about fifteen
                    <lb/>years ago in a Missionary capacity, describes <lb/>them as a people
                    constantly employing their <lb/>thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes for
                    <lb/>taking advantage of strangers. Their population <lb/>is very numerous;
                    which he remarked to some of <lb/>them, to whom he gave a description of Ota<lb
                        break="no"/>heite, observing at the same time, that its in<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>habitants were less numerous:&#x2013;" Can't we go <lb/>and take them?-
                    What is there to hinder us?" was <lb/>immediately demanded. This anecdote we
                        no<lb break="no"/>tice as a specimen of their natural inclination to
                    <lb/>hostility, in which, all accounts respecting them <lb/>correspond.</p>

                <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler, and <lb/>part of the crew
                    of the India brig Matilda, which sailed from <lb/>this Colony in August 1813,
                    bound on a voyage to the Derwent <lb/>and Eastern Islands, and from thence to
                    China; but was cut off <lb/>and plundered on the night of the 10th of April
                    last, while lying <lb/>at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one
                    of the <lb/>Marquessas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poo<lb

                    the vessel afloat, they con<lb break="no"/>curred universally in the design of
                    putting the whole of her crew <lb/>to death; which appears to have been a

                    their canoes hap<lb break="no"/>pen too fall upon a strange land, through stress
                    of weather, or from <lb/>any other accident.</p>
                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief, or <lb/>King, Nooahetu,
                    who presided at the horrible tribunal that had <lb/>devoted the unfortunate

                    vessel. The crew were informed by such <lb/>expressions as they could
                    understand, as well as by the gesticula<lb break="no"/>tions that accompanied
                    their vehement debate on the occasion, <lb/>that their lives were dependent on
                    the issue; the good Chief <lb/>was opposed by many other Chiefs, who, though
                    somewhat in<lb break="no"/>ferior in rank, were very far superior in number,
                    supported by <lb/>the common usages of the island, from which the exhibition of
                    <lb/>clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated, <lb/>with his
                    son by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had <lb/>been called to the
                    supremacy of the island by the general wish of <lb/>the people, as it was not a
                    hereditary right, but an elective dig<lb break="no"/>nity. His people pressed
                    their solicitations earnestly , and at <lb/>length peremptorily demanded his
                    assent to the sacrifice; which he <lb/>for a length of time opposed by the force
                    of words, which not <lb/>seeming likely to prevail, he adopted a method which
                    silenced <lb/>the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Captain Fowler
                    <lb/>and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated, <lb/>on
                    the principle of undeviating custom, he deliberately took <lb/>up two ropes that
                    were near him, and fixing one round the neck <lb/>of his son, and the other
                    round his own, called to the Chief next <lb/>in command, who immediately
                    approached him. His conference <lb/>was short and decisive&#x2013;he first
                    pointed to the cord that encircled <lb/>the neck of his son, and then to the
                    other which he had entwined <lb/>around his own. "These strangers are doomed to
                    death," said <lb/>he, "by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I, who
                    <lb/>am their King, should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated.&#x2013;
                    <lb/>Let my child and myself be strangled before it is performed; and <lb/>then
                    it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye<lb break="no"
                    />sight, the destruction of these unoffending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than <lb/>produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm <lb/>of surprise, mingled with
                    a sentiment of admiration, in which the <lb/>untaught man may possibly excel his
                    fellow creature, whose con<lb break="no"/>ceptions are moulded by tenets
                    calculated to guard him from the <lb/>extremes of passion. For a moment the
                    people looked wildly <lb/>upon their King, whose person they adored, because
                    that his <lb/>principles were good, and his government just and mild. They
                    <lb/>saw the obedient Chief, to whom the order of strangulation had <lb/>been
                    imparted, staring with horror and amazement at the change <lb/>which a few
                    moments had produced; the mandate, which had <lb/>proceeded from the King's own
                    lips must be obeyed; and, com<lb break="no"/>manded to perform the dreadful
                    office, he proceeded to obey&#x2013; <lb/>when a sudden shout from the multitude
                    awed him to forbear<lb break="no"/>ance. "The King! the King!" from every lip
                    burst forth&#x2013; <lb/>'What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers
                    live&#x2013;no <lb/>man shall kill the King!" Thus were their lives preserved,
                    and <lb/>the vessel plundered of every thing on board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, <lb/>still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. All her iron and copper <lb/>have been taken out by the
                    natives, who have a thorough know<lb break="no"/>ledge of the use of these
                    materials. That they are cannibals is <lb/>well ascertained. They form distinct
                    factions, and make war <lb/>upon the ruling Chief. The rebels are denominated
                    the Typees; <lb/>and the opposite parties are horribly sanguinary towards
                    each.&#x2013; <lb/>Six of the adverse party were killed and devoured by the
                        re<lb break="no"/>bels while Captain Fowler was among them, and the
                    following <lb/>detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion:&#x2013;A native
                    <lb/>man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and <lb/>in
                    consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain <lb/>of death,
                    impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murder<lb break="no"/>ed
                    bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a <lb/>voracious
                    fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet <lb/>coagulated.</p>

                <p><pb n="1"/> By the Governor Macquarie are arrived Capt. <lb/>Fowler, and part of
                    the crew of the India brig Matil<lb break="no"/>da, which sailed from this
                    Colony in Aug. 1813, bound <lb/>on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands,
                    and <lb/>from thence to China, but was cut off and plundered <lb/>on the night
                    of the 10th of April last, while lying <lb/>at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the
                    Island of Rooapoah, <lb/>one of the Marquesas, on a sandal-wood voyage.&#x2013;
                    <lb/>Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously de<lb break="no"/>serted,
                    and joining with some of the Rooapoah <lb/>natives, took the opportunity of a
                    dark night, and <lb/>the wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the
                    <lb/>vessel adrift; by which means she drove ashore <lb/>through a heavy surf,
                    and was soon bilged and filled <lb/>with water.&#x2013;When the cannibal natives
                    saw that <lb/>it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat, they <lb/>concurred
                    universally in the design of putting the <lb/>whole of her crew to death, which
                    appears to have <lb/>been a constant practise among the different islanders
                    <lb/>towards one another, when their canoes happen <lb/>by accident to fall upon
                    a strange shore, through <lb/>stress of weather, or from any other accident.
                    Capt. <cb/>
                    <lb/>Fowler had formed an intimacy with their chief, or king, <lb/>Nooakretu,
                    who presided at the horrible tribunal <lb/>that had devoted the unfortunate
                    mariners to in <lb/>stant slaughter:&#x2013;He withheld his assent to the
                    <lb/>murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the <lb/>plunder of the vessel.
                    The crew were informed by <lb/>such expressions as they could understand, as
                    well <lb/>as by the gesticulations that accompanied their ve<lb break="no"
                    />hement debate on the occasion, that their lives were <lb/>dependent on the
                    issue; the good chief was oppo<lb break="no"/>sed by many other chiefs, who,
                    though somewhat infe<lb break="no"/>rior in rank, were very far superior in
                    number, sup <lb/>ported by the common usages of the island, from which <lb/>the
                    exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable <lb/>deviation. He was seated,
                    with his son by his side, <lb/>on a mat in his own dwelling; He had been called
                    <lb/>to the supremacy of the island by the general wish <lb/>of the people, as
                    it was not a hereditary right, but an <lb/>elective dignity. His people pressed
                    their solici<lb break="no"/>tations earnestly; and at length peremptorily de<lb
                        break="no"/>manded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a <lb/>length
                    of time opposed by the force of words, <lb/>which not seeming likely to prevail,
                    he adopted a <lb/>method which silenced the whole in an instant, and <lb/>saved
                    the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Find <lb/>ing that all his
                    expostulations were defeated upon the <lb/>principle of undeviating custom, he
                    deliberately <lb/>took up two ropes that were near him, and fixing <lb/>one
                    round the neck of his son, and the other round <lb/>his own, called to the chief
                    next in command, who <lb/>immediately approached him. His conference was
                    <lb/>short and decisive: he first pointed to the cord that <lb/>encircled the
                    neck of his son, and then to the other <lb/>which he had entwined around his
                    own. "These <lb/>strangers are doomed to death," said he, "by my <lb/>chiefs and
                    my people: and it is not fit that I, who <lb/>am their King, should live to see
                    so vile a deed per <lb/>petrated. Let my child and myself be strangled
                    <lb/>before it is performed and then it never will be said <lb/>that we
                    sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the de<lb break="no"/>struction of these
                    unoffending people." The mag<lb break="no"/>nanimity of such a conduct could not
                    do less than <lb/>produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened <lb/>savage, a
                    paroxysm of surprise, mingled with a sen<lb break="no"/>timent of admiration in
                    which the untaught man may <lb/>possibly excel his fellow creature - whose
                    concep <lb/>tions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him <lb/>from the
                    extremes of passion. For a moment the people <lb/>looked wildly upon their King,
                    whose person they <lb/>adored, because that his principles were good, and
                    <lb/>his government just and mild. They saw the obedi<lb break="no"/>ent chief,
                    to whom the order of strangulation had <lb/>been imparted, staring with horror
                    and amazement <lb/>at the change which a few moments had produced; <lb/>The
                    mandate that had proceeded from the King's <lb/>own lips must be obeyed: and,
                    commanded to per<lb break="no"/>form the dreadful office, he proceeded to
                    obey&#x2013; <lb/>when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him <lb/>to
                    forbearance. "The King! The King!" from <lb/>every lip burst
                    forth:&#x2013;'What! kill the King! No, <lb/>no, let all the strangers live: no
                    man shall kill the <lb/>King!"&#x2013;Thus were their lives preserved&#x2013;and
                    the <lb/>vessel plundered of everything on board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at <lb/>Nooaheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. <lb/>All her iron and copper have been taken out by the
                    <lb/>natives, who have a thorough knowledge of the <lb/>use of these metals.
                    That they are cannibals is well <lb/>ascertained. They form distinct factions,
                    and make <lb/>war upon the ruling chief. The rebels are deno <lb/>minated the
                        <hi rend="italic">Typees</hi>; and the opposite parties are <lb/>horribly
                    sanguinary towards each other. Six of the <lb/>adverse party were killed and
                    devoured by the rebels <lb/>while Captain Fowler was among them, and the
                    <lb/>following detestable circumstance occurred on the <lb/>occasion. A native
                    man belonging to Port Anna <lb/>Maria, who was not tattoo'd, and in consequence
                    <lb/>prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain <lb/>of death, impatient
                    of the restraint, fell upon one <lb/>of the murdered bodies, and darting his
                    teeth into <lb/>it in all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled <lb/>the
                    crimson moisture, which had not yet coagulated.</p>
                <p>The chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very <lb/>friendly to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, <lb/>the first part of the name implying the outrigger <lb/>of a
                    canoe, and the latter signifying <hi rend="italic">Great</hi>.&#x2013; <lb/>The
                    dress, of the men consists merely of a wrapper <lb/>about the waist; the women
                    are covered from the <lb/>shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are gene
                    <lb/>rally fairer than the Tahitian women. The chiefs <lb/>have no
                    distinguishing mark or ornament, but in <lb/>the mode of wearing their hair;
                    which the common <lb/>orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of
                    <lb/>the head, a stripe of which, extending from the <lb/>forehead to the hollow
                    of the neck, is kept shorn, <lb/>which practice the chiefs do not adopt. Capt.
                        Fow<lb break="no"/>ler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and de<lb
                        break="no"/>structive to the ships' bottoms there, than he has any<lb
                        break="no"/>where else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the
                    <lb/>caution of the natives in drawing up their largest <lb/>canoes, some of
                    which contain from 80 to 100 war <lb/>riors. They are anxious after every kind
                    of pro<lb break="no"/>perty carried among them for barter, and this is
                    <lb/>supposed their chief inducement for attacking ves<lb break="no"/>sels when
                    they can do so with a probability of ac <lb/>complishing their object. They have
                    no knowledge <lb/>of the use of muskets; and have none among them <lb/>except a
                    few at Port Anna Maria. A gentleman at <lb/>this time in Sydney, who resided
                    among them about <lb/>15 years ago in a Missionary capacity, describes <lb/>them
                    as a people constantly employing their thoughts <cb/>
                    <lb/>on plunder, and devising schemes for taking ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of
                    strangers. Their population is very <lb/>numerous; which he remarked to some of
                    them, to <lb/>whom he gave a description of Otaheite, observing <lb/>at the same
                    time that its inhabitants were less nu<lb break="no"/>merous:&#x2013;"<hi
                        rend="italic">Can't we go and take them?&#x2013;what is <lb/>there to hinder
                        us</hi>?"&#x2013;was immediately demanded. <lb/>This anecdote we notice as a
                    specimen of their na<lb break="no"/>tural inclination to hostility, in which,
                    all accounts <lb/>respecting them correspond.</p>

                </p>
                <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain <lb/>Fowler, and part of the crew
                    of the India brig Ma<lb break="no"/>tilda, which sailed from this colony in
                    August, 1813, <lb/>bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands,
                    <lb/>and from thence to China; but was cut off and plun<lb break="no"/>dered on
                    the night of the 10th of April last, while lying <lb/>at anchor in Duff's Bay,
                    at the Island of Rooapoah, <lb/>one of the Marquesas, on a sandal wood voyage.
                    Five <lb/>of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, <lb/>and joining
                    with some of the Rooapoah natives, took <lb/>the opportunity of a dark night,
                    and the wind blowing <lb/>fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift; by
                    <lb/>which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf, <lb/>and was soon bilged
                    and filled with water. When the <lb/>cannibal natives saw that it was
                    impracticable to get the <lb/> vessel afloat, they concurred universally in the
                    design <lb/>of putting the whole of her crew to death, which ap<lb break="no"
                    />pears to have been a constant practise among the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent
                    natives towards one another, when their canoes <lb/>happen to fall upon a
                    strange shore, through stress of <lb/>weather, or from any other accident.</p>
                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their <lb/>Chief, or King, Nooahetu,
                    who presided at the horrible <lb/>tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate
                    mariners to in<lb break="no"/>stant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the
                        mur<lb break="no"/>der; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of
                    <lb/>the vessel. The crew were informed by such expres<lb break="no"/>sions as
                    they could understand, as well as by gesticula<lb break="no"/>tions that
                    accompanied their vehement debate on the <lb/>occasion, that their lives were
                    dependent on the issue; <lb/>the good chief was opposed by many other Chiefs,
                    <lb/>who, though somewhat inferior in rank, were very far <lb/>superior in
                    number, supported by the common usages <lb/>of the island, from which the
                    exhibition of clemency <lb/>appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated,
                    <lb/>with his son by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; <lb/>he had been
                    called to the supremacy of the island by the <lb/>general wish of the people, as
                    it was not a hereditary <lb/>right, but an elective dignity. His people pressed
                    their <lb/>solicitations earnestly, and at length peremptorily de<lb break="no"
                    />manded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length <lb/>of time opposed
                    by the force of words, which not seem<lb break="no"/>ing likely to prevail, he
                    adopted a method which si<lb break="no"/>lenced the whole in an instant, and
                    saved the lives of <lb/>Captain Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his ex<lb
                        break="no"/>postulations were defeated upon the principle of unde<lb
                        break="no"/>viating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that <lb/>were
                    near him, and fixing one round the neck of his <lb/>son, and the other round his
                    own, called to the Chief <lb/>next in command, who immediately approached him.
                    <lb/>His conference was short and decisive; he first pointed <lb/>to the cord
                    that encircled the neck of his son, and then <lb/>to the other which he had
                    entwined around his own. <lb/>"These strangers are doomed to death," said he,
                    "by <lb/>my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I, who <lb/>am their
                    King, should live to see so vile a deed perpe<lb break="no"/>trated. Let my
                    child and myself be strangled before it <lb/>is performed and then it never will
                    be said that we <lb/>sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the destruction of
                    <lb/>these unoffending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do <lb/>less than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlighten<lb break="no"/>ed savage, a paroxysm of surprise,
                    mingled with a sen<lb break="no"/>timent of admiration in which the untaught man
                    may <lb/>possibly excel his fellow creature, whose conceptions <lb/>are moulded
                    by tenets calculated to guard him from the <lb/>extremes of passion. For a
                    moment the people looked <lb/>wildly upon their King, whose person they adored,
                        be<lb break="no"/>cause that his principles were good, and his government
                    <lb/>just and mild. They saw the obedient chief, to whom <lb/>the order of
                    strangulation had been imparted, staring <lb/>with horror and amazement at the
                    change which a few <lb/>moments had produced; the mandate that had proceed<lb
                        break="no"/>ed from the King's own lips must be obeyed: and <lb/>commanded
                    to perform the dreadful office, he proceed<lb break="no"/>ed to obey&#x2013;when
                    a sudden shout from the multitude <lb/>awed him to forbearance. "The King! the
                    King!" from <lb/>every lip burst forth:&#x2013;"What! kill the King! <lb/>No,
                    no, let all the strangers live&#x2013;no man shall kill the
                    <lb/>King!"&#x2013;Thus were their lives preserved and the <lb/>vessel plundered
                    of every thing on board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at <lb/>Nooaheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. All <lb/>her iron and copper have been taken out by the
                    natives, <lb/>who have a thorough knowledge of the use of these m<lb break="no"
                    />aterials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. <lb/>They form distinct
                    factions, and make war upon the <lb/>ruling Chief; the rebels are denominated
                    the Typees; <lb/>and the opposing parties are horribly sanguinary towards
                    <lb/>each. Six of the adverse party were killed, and de<lb break="no"/>voured by
                    the rebels while Captain Fowler was among <lb/>them, and the following
                    detestable circumstance oc<lb break="no"/>curred on the occasion:&#x2013;A
                    native man belonging to <lb/>Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and in
                        conse<lb break="no"/>quence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on
                    <lb/>pain of death, impatient of the restraint, fell upon one <lb/>of the
                    murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it in <lb/>all the madness of a
                    voracious fury, exhaled the crimson <lb/>moisture, which had not yet
                    coagulated.</p>
                <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly <lb/>to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of <lb/>the name implying the outrigger of a canoe,
                    and the <lb/>latter signifying great. The dress, of the men consists <lb/>merely
                    of a wrapper about the waist; the women are <lb/>covered from the shoulders
                    downwards to the ancles, <lb/>and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women.
                    The <lb/>Chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament, but in <lb/>the mode of
                    wearing their hair; which the common <lb/>orders wear tied up in a large knot on
                    each side of the <lb/>head, a stripe of which, extending from the forehead to
                    <lb/>the hollow of the neck, is kept shorn, which practice <lb/>the Chiefs do
                    not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the <lb/>worms to be more prevalent and
                    destructive to the ships' <lb/>bottoms there, than he has anywhere else
                    witnessed; and to <lb/>this cause attributes the caution of the natives in
                        draw<lb break="no"/>ing up their largest canoes, some of which contain from
                    <lb/>80 to 100 warriors. They are anxious after every <lb/>kind of property
                    carried among them for barter, and <lb/>this is supposed their chief inducement
                    for attacking <lb/>vessels when they can do so with a probability of ac<lb
                        break="no"/>complishing their object. They have no knowledge of <lb/>the use
                    of muskets, and have none among them except <lb/>a few at Port Anna Maria. A
                    gentleman, at this <lb/>time in Sydney, who resided among them about 15
                    <lb/>years ago in a missionary capacity, describes them as <lb/>a people
                    constantly employing their thoughts on plunder, <lb/>and devising schemes for
                    taking advantage of strangers. <lb/>Their population is very numerous; which he
                    remarked <lb/>to some of them, to whom he gave a description of <lb/>Otaheite,
                    observing, at the same time, that its inhabit<lb break="no"/>ants were less
                    numerous:&#x2013;"Cannot we go and take <lb/>them? What is there to hinder
                    us?"&#x2013;was immediately <lb/>demanded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen
                    of <lb/>their natural inclination to hostility, in which, all ac<lb break="no"
                    />counts respecting them correspond.</p>

                    />practicable to get the vessel afloat, they concurred univer<lb break="no"
                    />sally in the design of putting the whole of her crew to <lb/>death; which
                    appears to have been a constant practise <lb/>among the different natives
                    towards one another, when <lb/>their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore,
                    through <lb/>stress of weather, or from any other accident.</p>
                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their <lb/>Chief, or King, Nooahetu,
                    who presided at the horrible tri<lb break="no"/>bunal that had devoted the
                    unfortunate mariners to in<lb break="no"/>stant slaughter. He withheld his
                    assent to the murder; <lb/>but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of
                    the ves<lb break="no"/>sel. The crew were informed by such expressions as
                    <lb/>they could understand, as well as by gesticulations that <lb/>accompanied
                    their vehement debate on the occasion, that <lb/>their lives were dependent on
                    the issue; the good Chief <lb/>was opposed by many other Chiefs, who, though
                    somewhat <lb/>inferior in rank, were very far superior in number, support<lb
                        break="no"/>ed by the common usages of the island, from which the
                    <lb/>exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. <lb/>He was
                    seated, with his son by his side, on a mat in his <lb/>own dwelling: he had been
                    called to the supremacy of the <lb/>island by the general wish of the people, as
                    it was not a <lb/>hereditary right, but an elective dignity. His people pressed
                    <lb/>their solicitations earnestly, and at length peremptorily <lb/>demanded his
                    assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length <lb/>of time opposed by the force
                    of words, which not seem<lb break="no"/>ing likely to prevail, he adopted a
                    method which si<lb break="no"/>lenced the whole in an instant, and saved the
                    lives of <lb/>Captain Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his
                    <lb/>expostulations were defeated upon the principle of un<lb break="no"
                    />deviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that <lb/>were near him,
                    and fixing one round the neck of his son, <lb/>and the other round his own,
                    called to the Chief next in <lb/>command, who immediately approached him. His
                        con<lb break="no"/>ference was short and decisive; he first pointed to the
                    cord <lb/>that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other, <lb/>which
                    he had entwined around his own. "These strangers <lb/>are doomed to death," said
                    he, "by my chiefs and my <lb/>people, and it is not fit that I, who am their
                    King, should <lb/>live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and
                    <lb/>myself be strangled before it is performed; and then it <lb/>never will be
                    said that we sanctioned, even with our eye- <lb/>sight, the destruction of these
                    unoffending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less <lb/>than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlightened savage, <lb/>a paroxysm of surprise, mingled with
                    a sentiment of ad<lb break="no"/>miration in which the untaught man may possibly
                    excel <lb/>his fellow creature, whose conceptions are moulded by <lb/>tenets
                    calculated to guard him from the extremes of pas<lb break="no"/>sion. For a
                    moment the people looked wildly upon their <lb/>King, whose person they adored,
                    because that his prin<lb break="no"/>ciples were good, and his government just
                    and mild. <lb/>They saw the obedient chief, to whom the order of
                    <lb/>strangulation had been imparted, staring with horror <lb/>and amazement at
                    the change which a few moments <lb/>had produced; the mandate that had proceeded
                    from <lb/>the King's own lips must be obeyed;and commanded to <lb/>perform the
                    dreadful office, he proceeded to obey&#x2013;when a <lb/>sudden shout from the
                    multitude awed him to forbearance. <lb/>"The King! the King!" from every lip
                    burst forth:&#x2013; <lb/>"What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers
                    live <lb/>&#x2013;no man shall kill the King!" Thus were their lives
                    <lb/>preserved and the vessel plundered of every thing on <lb/>board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the <hi rend="italic">Greenwich</hi>, which was burnt at Nooa<lb
                        break="no"/>heva, still remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron
                    <lb/>and copper have been taken out by the natives, who have <lb/>a thorough
                    knowledge of the use of these materials. That <lb/>they are cannibals is well
                    ascertained. They form dis<lb break="no"/>tinct factions, and make war upon the
                    ruling Chief; the <lb/>rebels are denominated the Typees; and the opposing
                        par<lb break="no"/>ties are horribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the
                        ad<lb break="no"/>verse party were killed, and devoured by the rebels while
                    <lb/>Captain Fowler was among them, and the following de<lb break="no"/>testable
                    circumstance occurred on the occasion:&#x2013;A native <lb/>man belonging to
                    Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, <lb/>and in consequence prohibited from
                    the eating of human <lb/>flesh, on pain of death, impatient of the restraint,
                    fell upon <lb/>one of the murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it in
                    <lb/>all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson <lb/>moisture,
                    which had not yet coagulated.</p>
                <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to <lb/>Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the <lb/>name implying the outrigger of a canoe,
                    and the latter <lb/>signifying great. The dress, of the men consists merely
                    <lb/>of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered <lb/>from the shoulders
                    downwards to the ancles, and are gene<lb break="no"/>rally fairer than the
                    Taheitan women. The Chiefs have <lb/>no distinguishing mark or ornament, but in
                    the mode of <lb/>wearing their hair; which the common orders wear <lb/>tied up
                    in a large knot on each side of the head, a stripe <lb/>of which, extending from
                    the forehead to the hollow of the <lb/>neck, is kept shorn, which practice the
                    Chiefs do not <lb/>adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more
                    <lb/>prevalent and destructive to the ships' bottoms there, than he <lb/>has
                    anywhere else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the <lb/>caution of the
                    natives in drawing up their largest canoes, <lb/>some of which contain from 80
                    to 100 warriors. They <lb/>are anxious after every kind of property carried
                    among <lb/>them for barter, and this is supposed their chief induce<lb
                        break="no"/>ment for attacking vessels when they can do so with a
                    <lb/>probability of accomplishing their object. They have <lb/>no knowledge of
                    the use of muskets, and have none <lb/>among them except a few at Port Anna
                    Maria. A gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, at this time in Sydney, who resided among
                    them <lb/>about 15 years ago in a missionary capacity, describes <lb/>them as a
                    people constantly employing their thoughts on <lb/>plunder, and devising schemes
                    for taking advantage of <cb/>
                    <lb/>strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he <lb/>remarked to
                    some of them, to whom he gave a description <lb/>of Otaheite, observing, at the
                    same time, that its inhabit<lb break="no"/>ants were less
                    numerous:&#x2013;"Cannot we go and take <lb/>them? What is there to hinder
                    us?"&#x2013;was immediately de<lb break="no"/>manded. This anecdote we notice as
                    a specimen of their <lb/>natural inclination to hostility, in which, all
                    accounts re<lb break="no"/>specting them correspond.</p>

                    <lb/>Eastern Islands, and from thence to China; but was <lb/>cut off and
                    plundered on the night of the 10th of <lb/>April last, while lying at anchor in

                    <lb/>sandal wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo <lb/>men) had previously

                    through a heavy surf, and was soon <lb/>bilged and filled with water. When the

                <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with <lb/>their Chief, or King, Nooahetu,
                    who presided at the <lb/>horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate

                    were very far superior in number, supported <lb/>by the common usages of the

                    and then to the other, which he had <lb/>entwined around his own. "These

                    "The <lb/>King! the King!" from every lip burst forth&#x2013; <lb/>"What! kill
                    the King! No, no, let all the strangers <lb/>live &#x2013;no man shall kill the
                    King!" Thus were <lb/>their lives preserved&#x2013;and the vessel plundered of
                    <lb/>every thing on board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at <lb/>Nooaheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. All <lb/>her iron and copper have been taken out by the
                        na<lb break="no"/>tives, who have a thorough knowledge of the use of
                    <lb/>these materials. That they are cannibals is well as<lb break="no"
                    />certained. They form distinct factions, and make <lb/>war upon the ruling
                    Chief&#x2013;the rebels are denomi<lb break="no"/>nated the Typees; and the
                    opposing parties are hor<lb break="no"/>ribly sanguinary towards each. Six of
                    the adverse <lb/>party were killed, and devoured by the rebels while
                    <lb/>Captain <hi rend="smallcaps">Fowler</hi> was among them, and the following
                    <lb/>detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion:&#x2013; <lb/>A native man
                    belonging to Port Anna Maria, who <lb/>was not tattooed, and in consequence
                    prohibited from <lb/>the eating of human flesh, on pain of death, impa<lb
                        break="no"/>tient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murdered
                    <lb/>bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the mad<lb break="no"/>ness of
                    a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson mois<lb break="no"/>ture, which had not
                    yet coagulated.</p>
                <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very <lb/>friendly to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, the <lb/>first part of the name implying the outrigger of a
                    <lb/>canoe, and the latter signifying great. The dress of <lb/>the men consists
                    merely of a wrapper about the <lb/>waist; the women are covered from the
                    shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are generally fairer <lb/>than the
                    Taheitan women. The Chiefs have no dis<lb break="no"/>tinguishing mark or
                    ornament, but in the mode of <lb/>wearing their hair; which the common orders
                    wear <lb/>tied up in a large knot on each side of the head, a <lb/>stripe of
                    which, extending from the forehead to the <lb/>hollow of the neck, is kept
                    shorn, which practice the <lb/>Chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the
                    <lb/>worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the ships' <cb/>
                    <lb/>bottoms there, than he has anywhere else witnessed; and <lb/>to this cause
                    attributes the caution of the natives in <lb/>drawing up their largest canoes,
                    some of which con<lb break="no"/>tain from 80 to 100 warriors. They are anxious
                    <lb/>after every kind of property carried among them for <lb/>barter, and this
                    is supposed their chief inducement <lb/>for attacking vessels when they can do
                    so with a pro<lb break="no"/>bability of accomplishing their object. They have
                    <lb/>no knowledge of the use of muskets, and have none <lb/>among them except a
                    few at Port Anna Maria. A <lb/>Gentleman, at this time in Sydney, who resided
                    <lb/>among them about 15 years ago in a missionary ca<lb break="no"/>pacity,
                    describes them as a people constantly employ<lb break="no"/>ing their thoughts
                    on plunder, and devising schemes <lb/>for taking advantage of strangers. Their
                        popula<lb break="no"/>tion is very numerous; which he remarked to <lb/>some
                    of them, to whom he gave a description of Otaheite, observing, at the same time,
                    that its inhabitants were <lb/>less numerous:&#x2013;"Cannot we go and take
                    them?&#x2013; <lb/>What is there to hinder us?"&#x2013;was immediately de<lb
                        break="no"/>manded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen of <lb/>their
                    natural inclination to hostility, in which, all ac<lb break="no"/>counts
                    respecting them correspond.</p>

                <p>By the <hi rend="italic">Governor Macquarrie</hi> are arrived Captain

                        >Matilda</hi>, which sailed from this colony in August, 1813, bound <lb/>on
                    a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands, and <lb/>from thence to China; but
                    was cut off and plundered on <lb/>the night of the 10th of April last, while
                    lying at anchor <lb/>in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the
                    <lb/>Marquessas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew <lb/>(Poomootoo men)
                    had previously deserted, and joining <lb/>with some of the Rooapoah natives,
                    took the opportunity <lb/>of a dark night, and the wind blowing fresh right on
                    <lb/>the land, to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she <lb/>drove ashore
                    through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged <lb/>and filled with water. When the
                    cannibal natives saw <lb/>that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat,
                    they <lb/>concurred universally in the design of putting the whole <lb/>of her
                    crew to death; which appears to have been a con<lb break="no"/>stant practise
                    among the different natives towards one another, when their canoes happen to
                    fall upon a strange <lb/>shore, through stress of weather, or from any other
                        a<lb break="no"/>ccident.</p>
                <p>Capt. Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief, <lb/>or King, Nooahetu, who
                    presided at the horrible tribunal <lb/>that had devoted the unfortunate mariners
                    to instant <lb/>slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; but <lb/>had no
                    hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel. <lb/>The crew were informed
                    by such expressions as they <lb/>could understand, as well as by gesticulations
                    that <lb/>accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, <lb/>that their
                    lives were dependent on the issue; <lb/>the good Chief was opposed by many other
                    Chiefs, who, though <lb/>somewhat inferior in rank, were very far superior in
                        num<lb break="no"/>ber, supported by the common usages of the island, from
                    <lb/>which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable <lb/>deviation.
                    He was seated, with his son by his side, on <lb/>a mat in his own dwelling; he
                    had been called to the <lb/>supremacy of the island by the general wish of the
                    people, <lb/>as it was not a hereditary right, but an elective dignity. <lb/>His
                    people pressed their solicitations earnestly, and at <lb/>length peremptorily
                    demanded his assent to the sacrifice; <lb/>which he for a length of time opposed
                    by the force of <lb/>words; which not seeming likely to prevail, he adopted
                    <lb/>a method which silenced the whole in an instant, and <lb/>saved the lives
                    of Captain Fowler and his crew. Find<lb break="no"/>ing that all his
                    expostulations were defeated upon the <lb/>principle of undeviating custom, he
                    deliberately took up <lb/>two ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the
                    <lb/>neck of his son, and the other round his own, called to <lb/>the Chief next
                    in command, who immediately approached <lb/>him. His conference was short and
                    decisive; he first <lb/>pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son,
                    <lb/>and then to the other, which he had entwined round his <lb/>own. "These
                    strangers are doomed to death," said he, <lb/>"by my chiefs and my people, and
                    it is not fit that I, <lb/>who am their King, should live to see so vile a deed
                        per<lb break="no"/>petrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before
                    <lb/>it is performed; and then it never will be said that we <lb/>sanctioned,
                    even with our eye-sight, the destruction of <lb/>these unoffending people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less <lb/>than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlightened sa<lb break="no"/>vage, a paroxysm of surprise,
                    mingled with a sentiment <lb/>of admiration in which the untaught man may
                    possibly <lb/>excel his fellow-creature &#x2013;whose conceptions are mould<lb
                        break="no"/>ed by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes <lb/>of
                    passion. For a moment the people looked wildly <lb/>upon their King, whose
                    person they adored, because that <lb/>his principles were good, and his
                    government just and <lb/>mild. They saw the obedient Chief, to whom the order
                    <lb/>of strangulation had been imparted, staring with horror <lb/>and amazement
                    at the change which a few moments <lb/>had produced; the mandate that had
                    proceeded from <lb/>the King's own lips must be obeyed; and commanded to
                    <lb/>perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey&#x2013;when <lb/>a sudden
                    shout from the multitude awed him to forbear<lb break="no"/>ance. "The King! the
                    King!" from every lip burst <lb/>forth&#x2013; "What! kill the King! No, no, let
                    all the stran<lb break="no"/>gers live &#x2013;no man shall kill the King!" Thus
                    were their <lb/>lives preserved&#x2013;and the vessel plundered of every thing
                    <lb/>on board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooa<lb break="no"/>heva, still
                    remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron <lb/>and copper have been taken
                    out by the natives, who have <lb/>a thorough knowledge of the use of these
                    materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form dis<lb
                        break="no"/>tinct factions, and make war upon the ruling Chief; the
                    <lb/>rebels are denominated the Typees; and the opposing par<lb break="no"/>ties
                    are horribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the ad<lb break="no"/>verse party
                    were killed, and devoured by the rebels while <lb/>Captain Fowler was among
                    them, and the following de<lb break="no"/>testable circumstance occurred on the
                    occasion:&#x2013;A na<lb break="no"/>tive man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who
                    was not <lb/>tattooed, and in consequence prohibited from the eating <lb/>of
                    human flesh, on pain of death, impatient of the re<lb break="no"/>straint, fell
                    upon one of the murdered bodies, and dart<lb break="no"/>ing his teeth into it
                    in all the madness of a voracious <lb/>fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which
                    had not yet <lb/>coagulated.</p>
                <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly <lb/>to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of <lb/>the name implying the outrigger of a canoe,
                    and the lat<lb break="no"/>ter signifying great. The dress of the men consists
                    <lb/>merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are co<lb break="no"/>vered
                    from the shoulders downwards to the ancles, and <lb/>are generally fairer than
                    the Taheitan women. The Chiefs <lb/>have no distinguishing mark or ornament, but
                    in the <lb/>mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders <lb/>wear tied
                    up in a large knot on each side of the head, a <lb/>stripe of which, extending
                    from the forehead to the hol<lb break="no"/>low of the neck, is kept shorn,
                    which practice the Chiefs <lb/>do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms
                    to <lb/>be more prevalent and destructive to the ships' <cb/>bottoms there,
                    <lb/>than he has anywhere else witnessed; and to this cause at<lb break="no"
                    />tributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their <lb/>largest canoes,
                    some of which contain from 80 to 100 <lb/>warriors. They are anxious after every
                    kind of property <lb/>carried among them for barter, and this is supposed their
                    <lb/>chief inducement for attacking vessels when they can <lb/>do so with a
                    probability of accomplishing their object. <lb/>They have no knowledge of the
                    use of muskets, and <lb/>have none among them except a few at Port Anna
                    <lb/>Maria. A <lb/>gentleman, at this time in Sydney, who resided among them
                    about 15 years ago, in a missionary capacity, describes them as a people
                    constantly employ<lb break="no"/>ing their thoughts on plunder, and devising
                    schemes for <lb/>taking advantage of strangers. Their population is very
                    <lb/>numerous; which he remarked to some of them, to whom <lb/>he gave a
                    description of Otaheite; observing, at the same time, that its inhabitants were
                    less numerous:&#x2013;"Cannot we go and take them?&#x2013;What is there to
                    hinder us?"&#x2013; <lb/>was immediately demanded. This anecdote we notice
                    <lb/>as a specimen of their natural inclination to hostility, in <lb/>which, all
                    accounts respecting them correspond.</p>

                            the Mar<lb break="no"/>quesas Islands.</hi>
                        <lb/>[<hi rend="italic">From the Sydney Gazette, Nov</hi>. 8, 1815.]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fow<lb break="no"/>ler, and part
                    of the crew of the India brig Matilda, <lb/>which sailed from this colony in
                    August 1813, bound <lb/>on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands, and from
                    thence to China; but was cut off and plundered <lb/>on the night of the 10th of
                    April last, while lying at <lb/>anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah,
                    one <lb/>of the Marquesas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of <lb/>the crew
                    (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, <lb/>and joining with some of the
                    Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night, and the wind blowing
                    <lb/>fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift; by <lb/>which means she
                    drove ashore through a heavy surf, <lb/>and was soon bilged and filled with
                    water. When the <lb/>cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get
                    <lb/>the vessel afloat, they concurred universally in the de<lb break="no"/>sign
                    of putting the whole of her crew to death; which <lb/>appears to have been a
                    constant practise among the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent natives towards one
                    another, when their canoes <lb/>happen to fall upon a strange shore, through
                    stress <lb/>of weather, or from any other accident.</p>
                <p>Capt. Fowler had formed an intimacy with their <lb/>Chief, or King, Nooahetu, who
                    presided at the horri<lb break="no"/>ble tribunal that had devoted the
                    unfortunate mariners <lb/>to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the
                    <lb/>murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plun<lb break="no"/>der of
                    the vessel. The crew were informed by such ex<lb break="no"/>pressions as they
                    could understand, as well as by gesti<lb break="no"/>culations that accompanied
                    their vehement debate on <lb/>the occasion, that their lives were dependent on
                    the <lb/>issue; the good Chief was opposed by many other <lb/>Chiefs, who,
                    though somewhat inferior in rank, were <lb/>very far superior in number,
                    supported by the common <lb/>usages of the island, from which the exhibition of
                        cle<lb break="no"/>mency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was
                    <lb/>seated, with his son by his side, on a mat in his own <lb/>dwelling; he had
                    been called to the supremacy of the <lb/>island by the general wish of the
                    people, as it was not <lb/>an hereditary right, but an elective dignity. His
                        peo<lb break="no"/>ple pressed their solicitations earnestly, and at length
                    <lb/>peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which <lb/>he for a
                    length of time opposed by the force of words, <lb/>which not seeming likely to
                    prevail, <lb/>he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant, and
                    saved <lb/>the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Finding that <lb/>all his
                    expostulations were defeated upon the principle <lb/>of undeviating custom, he
                    deliberately took up two <lb/>ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the
                    <lb/>neck of his son, and the other round his own, called to <lb/>the Chief next
                    in command, who immediately approach<lb break="no"/>ed him. His conference was
                    short and decisive; he <lb/>first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of
                    his <lb/>son, and then to the other, which he had entwined <lb/>round his own.
                    "These strangers are doomed to <lb/>death," said he, "by my Chiefs and my
                    people, and <lb/>it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to
                    <lb/>see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and my<lb break="no"/>self be
                    strangled before it is performed; and then it <cb/>
                    <lb/>never will be said that we sanctioned, even with <lb/>our eye-sight, the
                    destruction of these unoffending <lb/>people."</p>
                <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do <lb/>less than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlighten<lb break="no"/>ed savage, a paroxysm of surprise,
                    mingled with a <lb/>sentiment of admiration, in which the untaught man <lb/>may
                    possibly excel his fellow-creature, whose concep<lb break="no"/>tions are
                    moulded by tenets calculated to guard him <lb/>from the extremes of passion. For
                    a moment the people <lb/>looked wildly upon their King, whose person they
                    <lb/>adored, because that his principles were good, and his <lb/>government just
                    and mild. They saw the obedient <lb/>chief, to whom the order of strangulation
                    had been im<lb break="no"/>parted, staring with horror and amazement at the
                    <lb/>change which a few moments had produced; the man<lb break="no"/>date that
                    had proceeded from the King's own lips <lb/>must be obeyed; and commanded to
                    perform the dread<lb break="no"/>ful office, he proceeded to obey&#x2013;when a
                    sudden shout <lb/>from the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The <lb/>King!
                    the King!" from every lip burst forth&#x2013; "What! <lb/>kill the King! No, no,
                    let all the strangers live &#x2013;no <lb/>man shall kill the King!" Thus were
                    their lives pre<lb break="no"/>served&#x2013;and the vessel plundered of every
                    thing on <lb/>board her.</p>
                <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at <lb/>Nooaheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. All <lb/>her iron and copper have been taken out by the
                    natives, <lb/>who have a thorough knowledge of the use of these ma<lb break="no"
                    />terials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. <lb/>They form distinct
                    factions, and make war upon the rul<lb break="no"/>ing Chief; the rebels are
                    denominated the Typees; and <lb/>the opposing parties are horribly sanguinary
                    towards each <lb/>other. Six of the adverse party were killed, and devour<lb
                        break="no"/>ed by the rebels while Capt. Fowler was among them, <lb/>and the
                    following detestable circumstance occurred on <lb/>the occasion:&#x2013;A native
                    man belonging to Port Anna <lb/>Maria, who was not tattooed, and in consequence
                        pro<lb break="no"/>hibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain of
                    <lb/>death, impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the <lb/>murdered
                    bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the <lb/>madness of a voracious
                    fury, exhaled the crimson mois<lb break="no"/>ture, which had not yet
                    coagulated.</p>
                <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly <lb/>to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, the first part <lb/>of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe,
                    and the <lb/>latter signifying great. The dress of the men consists <lb/>merely
                    of a wrapper about the waist; the women are <lb/>covered from the shoulders
                    downwards to the ancles, <lb/>and are generally fairer than the Taheitan women.
                    The <lb/>Chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament, but <lb/>in the mode of
                    wearing their hair; which the common <lb/>orders wear tied up in a large knot on
                    each side of the <lb/>head, a stripe of which, extending from the forehead to
                    <lb/>the hollow of the neck, is kept shorn, which practice <lb/>the Chiefs do
                    not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the <lb/>worms to be more prevalent and
                    destructive to the ships' <lb/>bottoms there, than he has anywhere else
                    witnessed; and to <lb/>this cause attributes the caution of the natives in
                        draw<lb break="no"/>ing up their largest canoes, some of which contain from
                    <lb/>80 to 100 warriors. They are anxious after every kind <lb/>of property
                    carried among them for barter, and this is <lb/>supposed their chief inducement
                    for attacking vessels <lb/>when they can do so with a probability of
                    accomplishing <lb/>their object. They have no knowledge of the use of
                    <lb/>muskets, and have none among them except a few at <lb/>Port Anna Maria. A
                    gentleman, at this time in Syd<lb break="no"/>ney, who resided among them about
                    15 years ago, in a <lb/>missionary capacity, describes them as a people con<lb
                        break="no"/>stantly employing their thoughts on plunder, and devis<lb
                        break="no"/>ing schemes for taking advantage of strangers. Their
                    <lb/>population is very numerous; which he remarked to <lb/>some of them, to
                    whom he gave a description of Ota<lb break="no"/>heite; observing, at the same
                    time, that its inhabitants were less numerous:&#x2013;"Cannot we go and take
                    them? <lb/>What is there to hinder us?"&#x2013;was immediately de<lb break="no"
                    />manded. This anecdote we notice as a specimen of <lb/>their natural
                    inclination to hostility, in which, all ac<lb break="no"/>counts respecting them
                    correspond.</p>

                    the poste of Niagara, Detroit, &amp;c. in <lb/> violation of the treat of 1783;
                    the exciting of <lb/>of the Creek and other Indians to make compen<lb break="no"
                    />sation for the property seized by the armies under <lb/>Lord Cornwalis, &amp;
                    in the Southern States, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to stipulation; the seizure of
                    American <lb/>ships bound to France; the impressing of Ameri<lb break="no"/>can
                    citizens to man our fleets; and finally, the <lb/>sullen silence which the
                    British Minister is alledg<lb break="no"/>ed to have uniformly maintained on the
                    subject of <lb/>the claims made by the Republic. </p>
                <p>The American Minister has, however, so little <lb/>hope of efficacy from these
                    representations, that <lb/>he has ordered in his tradesmen's bills, and made
                    <lb/> every other preparation for an abrupt departure. </p>
                <p>Not withstanding this alarming aspect of affairs, <lb/>we still must hope, that
                    no consequences subversive <lb/>of the pacific system at present subsisting
                    between <lb/>American and Great Britain will ensue; for ill-<lb break="no"
                    />judged and ignorant, indeed, of the true interests <lb/>of his country must
                    that Briton be (whatever his <lb/>rank) who would advise another American war
                    <lb/>&#x2013;a war which, reasoning of the future by the <lb/> sorrowful
                    experience of the past, can only serve to <lb/>increase the sum, and to swell
                    the catalogue of <lb/>human woes.</p>

                <head>SOUTH AMERICA</head>
                <p>
                    <pb n="1"/>
                    <hi rend="center">Extract of a letter from an Englishman, dated Lima, Sep<lb
                            break="no"/>temper 10, 1821</hi>
                </p>
                <p> "Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colo<lb break="no"/>nial town;
                    6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population;<lb/> the whites are about
                    1200 Europeans, and not as many <lb/>born in the country; the rest are blacks
                    and mulattoes. <lb/>Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never
                    <lb/> saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty <lb/> and misery
                    than in any town of the size in the world.&#x2013;<lb/>There are some few
                    splendid houses, but the rest so dis<lb break="no"/>gustingly filthy that you
                    cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets, as
                    in all A<lb break="no"/>merican towns, run at right angles; a powerful stream of
                    <lb/>water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. <lb/> The climate
                    must be bad, for the whole population look as <lb/>if turned out of the
                    hospitals for a day's air; a half-born <lb/> race&#x2013;melancholy in their
                    faces. On the whole coast of <lb/>Peru we made the same observation; the ague
                    very gene<lb break="no"/>ral, with fever&#x2013;their habits and manner of
                    living increase <lb/>the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet&#x2013;nights
                    very cold <lb/>&#x2013;I sleep under a heavy blanket, and could bear another; a
                    <lb/> thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the <lb/>heat
                    however is not excessive during summer; on the whole <lb/>not an oppressive
                    climate, if the people had any idea of living <lb/>in a rational way. Very few
                    families cook at home&#x2103;they <lb/>buy their greasy messes boiled in the
                    streets, in pulperias, <lb/>and in the squares; not six families in Lima that
                    have wine <lb/>on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours, and excuse
                    <lb/>themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by <lb/>saying it
                    gives the ague; the same person who denies him<lb break="no"/>self a glass of
                    wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in <lb/> the evening. Their money goes
                    in gambling, debauchery, <lb/>and dress; every woman, high and low, has her
                    price; a lady <lb/>takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you
                    <lb/>she is quite at good as her neighbours, and needs be no bet<lb break="no"
                    />ter. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause <lb/>of all the
                    degradation of South America; every Viceroy, <lb/> from Pizarro to Pezuela, was
                    a plunderer, a teacher of <lb/>immorality in words and deeds. The miserable
                    state of <lb/>this people seems incredible&#x2013;one must see to believe it;
                    <lb/>scarcely a young lady can read or write, or use a needle;<lb/> few houses
                    that the Devil has not appeared in; and a de<lb break="no"/>vout lady is
                    accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin <lb/> Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed
                    upon by knaves; as to <lb/>priestcraft, it reigns here in all its glory; a third
                    part of <lb/>Lima is covered with churches, some of them very splen<lb
                        break="no"/>did. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the <lb/>
                    single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns; if this <lb/>is worked to
                    advantage, it will produce six millions of <lb/>dollars; but if the country is
                    disturbed by war, not a dollar <lb/>will they have. The exports of Peru, in
                    ordinary times, <lb/>were five millions of dollars in pecie, and one million
                    in<lb/>produce. Mininng may be carried to any extent, it is true; <lb/>but this
                    requires tranquillity and good government. Peo<lb break="no"/>ple in Europe have
                    the most erroneous ideas or Peru; <lb/>every traveller and historian who has
                    written or talked a<lb break="no"/>bout it ought to be made to stand in the
                    pillory for a liar." </p>
                <p> "Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to <lb/>Upper Peru, is a
                    wretched village of hovels covered with <lb/>mud&#x2013;about 400 Mulattoes and
                    Indians&#x2013;placed on a sand <lb/>bank&#x2013;the people all in the
                    ague&#x2013;not a boat or ship of any <lb/>sort. The harbour-master came off on
                    bulsa, (two blad<lb break="no"/>ders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian. We
                    could not <lb/>get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultu<lb
                        break="no"/>vation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to
                    <lb/>fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to <lb/>twnety
                    hours, offering them any price for their tropical <lb/>fruits. </p>
                <p> "I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on <lb/>the ground;
                    borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery. <lb/>No such thing as a tavern;
                    never was. Letters of no use; <lb/>no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at
                    eight o'clock <lb/>to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable
                    <lb/>ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the
                    <lb/>chandelier; the house filled with smoke. </p>
                <p> "There are 82 titled families, mostly idiots&#x2013;all reduced <lb/>to poverty
                    by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war <lb/>be continued a year, Peru
                    will be the most wretched coun<lb break="no"/>try on the globe; indeed the
                    Indians will regain their em<lb break="no"/>pire, and exterminate all other
                    colours. the number of <lb/>blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy
                    thousand&#x2013;<lb/>25,000 in Lima and adjacent village, the total population

                <p> "About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty <lb/>country houses.
                    Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in <lb/>the greatest variety; fruits of
                    all climates in the market<lb break="no"/>place, the produce of the sea-shore

                    <lb/>produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those <lb/>about

                    no other hands <lb/>to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they
                    <lb/>will not work, and famine must ensue." </p>

                </p>
                <p> THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the <lb/>County of FAYETTE and State of
                    KENTUCKY. <lb/>The one track consists of 7000 acres, and is divided into <lb/>15
                    plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations, <lb/>are still
                    unsold, and are now offered at the low price of <lb/>137l. being only 5s. 6d.
                    per acre. The other track coun<lb break="no"/>sists of 3086 acres, and is to be
                    sold in one lot, at 5s. 6d. <lb/>per acre. There is a fine stream of water
                    running through <lb/>these two tracks of land, which communicates with the
                    <lb/>great river Ohio, so that Mills may be erect. </p>
                <p> In Fayette County is Lexington, where the Courts of the <lb/>State of Kentucky
                    are held, and where all public business <lb/>is transacted Lexington is in the
                    neighbourhood of these <lb/>lands, and Fayette county is the nearest and most
                    convenient <lb/>for Philadelphia, Baltimore, City of Washington, &amp;c. The
                    <lb/>soil of Kentucky is deep and black, and lies upon a bed of <lb/>lime-stone
                    and coal. THe natural grown of the country <lb/>are large walnuts, honey, poplar
                    and sugar trees. The <lb/>surface is covered with blue grass, clover, and wild
                    rye, <lb/>grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and <lb/>plants
                    grow spontaneously, and afford a beautiful blossom <lb/>of a rich and exquisite
                    fragrance. Cotton and sugar are <lb/>manufactured to advantage. wheat ,barley,
                    oats, flax, <lb/>and hemp, yield abundantly; indeed, it is assumed that
                    <lb/>there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre, but the <lb/>common
                    produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre. </p>
                <p> Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil, and fine cli<lb break="no"/>mate of
                    the country, no part of America has been to re<lb break="no"/>pidly settled. The
                    returns made to Congress, upon 1st May <lb/>1792 state them at 76 000. In March
                    1793, there were upwards of 100,000. And, from their astonishing increase
                    <lb/>since, they may be estimated at 200,000. Eleven years <lb/>ago, Kentucky
                    lay in a forest, but now she exhibits an <lb/>extensive settlement, divided into
                    seven populous counties, in <lb/>which are a great number of flourishing towns,
                    and con<lb break="no"/>tains more inhabitants than are in Georgia, Delaware, and
                    <lb/> Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Ken<lb break="no"
                    />tucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and <lb/>Schools are
                    established in every town. There is a Print<lb break="no"/>ing-office; a Weekly
                    Gazette published. There are Pa<lb break="no"/>per Mills, O<supplied
                        reason="copy blur">???</supplied> Mills, <supplied reason="copy blur"
                        >???</supplied>ing Mills, Saw Mills, and a great <lb/>number of Grist Mills.
                    Considerable quantities of Sugar, <lb/>are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works
                    are in every <lb/>part of the country, and the inhabitants are supplied at a
                    <lb/>low price. </p>
                <p> The taxes upon land are very low. Any person who <lb/>goes from Europe becomes
                    an American Citizen on his ar<lb break="no"/>rival in this new State, and is
                    entitled to be elected to any <lb/>office in the Commonwealth. </p>

                    <pb n="2"/> As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at <lb/> the opening of
                    the Congress of the <lb/>United States at New York, Nov. 6, gives an
                    <lb/>impartial account of the situation of that count<lb break="no"/>try, we are
                    persuaded it will be found not un<lb break="no"/>entertaining to our readers. </p>
                <p><hi rend="italics">Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the <lb/>House of

                    <lb/>IT is some aba<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>of the
                    satisfaction, with <lb/> which I meet you on the present occasion, <lb/>that in
                    felicitating you on a continuance of the <lb/>national prosperity, generally, I
                    am not able to <lb/>add to it information that Indian hostilities, <lb/>which
                    have for some time past, distressed our <lb/> western frontier, have terminated. </p>
                <p>You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less <lb/>concern than I communicate it,
                    that reiterated <lb/>endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have
                    <lb/>hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs <lb/>of preserving
                    hostility on the part of the tribes <lb/>with whom we are in contest. An earnest
                    desire <lb/>to procure tranquillity to the frontier&#x2013;to stop <lb/>the
                    further effusion of blood&#x2013;to arrest the pro<lb break="no"/>gress of
                    expense&#x2013;to forward the prevalent wish of <lb/>the nation, for peace, has
                    led to strenuous efforts, <lb/>through various channels, to accomplish these
                        de<lb break="no"/>sirable puposes:&#x2013;In making which efforts, I
                    <lb/>consulted less my own anticipations of the events, <lb/>or the scruples
                    which some considerations were <lb/>calculated to inspire, than the wish to find
                    the ob<lb break="no"/>ject attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, the
                    <lb/>such is the case. </p>
                <p/>
                <p>A detail of the measures which have been pur<lb break="no"/>sued, and of their
                    consequences, which will be <lb/>laid before you, while it will confirm to you
                    the <lb/>want of success, thu s far, will, I trust, evince <lb/>that means, as
                    proper and as efficacious, as could <lb/>have been devised, have been employed.
                    The <lb/>issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; <lb/>but a
                    favourable one, though not to be despaired <lb/>of, is not promised by any thing
                    that has yet hap<lb break="no"/>pened. </p>
                <p>In the course of the attempts which have been <lb/>made, some valuable citizens
                    have fallen victims <lb/>to their zeal for the public service. A sanction
                    <lb/>commonly respected, even among savages, has been <lb/>found, in this
                    instance, insufficient to protect <lb/>from massacre, the emissaries of peace;
                    it will I <cb/>presume, be duly considered, whether the occasion<lb/>does not
                    call for an exercise of liberality towards <lb/>the families of the deceased. </p>
                <p>It must add to your concern, to be informed, <lb/>what besides the continuation
                    of hostile appearances <lb/>among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threat<lb

                    <lb/>settlements. </p>
                <p> It was hoped that the treat of Holston, made <lb/>with the Cherokee nation, in
                    July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. <lb/> But the
                    event has not answered this hope. The <lb/>Chickamagas, aided by some banditti
                    of another <lb/>tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated <lb/>wanton
                    and unproved hostilities, upon the ci<lb break="no"/>tizens of the United States
                    in that quarter. </p>
                <p> I have reason to believe, that every predictable <lb/>exertion has been made
                    (pursuant to the provision <lb/>by law for that purpose) to be prepared for
                    <lb/>the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the <lb/>event of a failure
                    of pacific overtures. A large <lb/>proportion of the troops authorized to be
                    raised, <lb/>have been recruited, though the number is still <lb/>incomplete.
                    And pains have been taken to disci<lb break="no"/>pline, and put them in
                    condition for the particu<lb break="no"/>lar kind of service to be performed. A
                    delay of <lb/>operations (besides being dictated by the measures <lb/>which were
                    pursuing towards a pacific termin<lb break="no"/>tion of the war) has been in
                    itself deemed prefe<lb break="no"/>rable to immature efforts. A statement, from
                    the <lb/>proper department, with regard to the number <lb/>of troops raised, and
                    some other points which <lb/>have been suggested, will afford more precise in<lb
                        break="no"/>formation as a guide to the legislative consultations <lb/>and,
                    among other things, will enable Congress to <lb/>judge whether some additional
                    stimulus to the re<lb break="no"/>cruiting service may not be advisable. </p>
                <p>In looking forward to the future expence of <lb/>the operations, which may be
                    found inevitable, I <lb/>derive consolation from the information I receive
                    <lb/>that the product of the revenues for the present <lb/>year, is likely to
                    supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community, for the service
                    of the ensuing year. This however, will be bet<lb break="no"/>ter ascertained in
                    the course of the session; and it <lb/>is proper to add, that the information
                    alluded to <lb/>proceeds from the supposition of no material ex<lb break="no"
                    />tention of the spirit of hostilities. </p>
                <p> I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, without again recommending to
                    your considera<lb break="no"/>tion the expediency of more adequate provision
                    <lb/>for giving energy to the laws throughout our in<lb break="no"/>terior
                    frontier; and for restraining the commission <lb/>of outrages upon the Indians;
                    without which all <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> plans must
                    prove nugatory. To enable by <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ent
                    rewards the employment of qualified <lb/><supplied reason="copy blur"
                        >???</supplied> persons to reside among them, as agents, <lb/> would also
                    contribute to the preservation of peace <lb/>and good neighbourhood. If in
                    addition to these expedients, an eligible plan could be devised for
                    <lb/>promoing civilization among the friendly tribes, <lb/>and for carrying on
                    trade with them upon a scale <lb/>equal to their wants, and under regulation
                        calc<lb break="no"/>tion, its influence in cementing their interest
                    <lb/>with ours could not but be considerable. </p>
                <p> The prosperous state of our revenue had been <lb/>intimated&#x2013;This would be
                    still more the case, <lb/>were it not for the impediments which in some <cb/>places continue to embarrass the collection of <supplied reason="copy curved">???</supplied><lb/>duties on spirits, distilled within the United States.</p><p>These impediments have lessened, and are <supplied reason="copy wrapped">?ess???d</supplied><lb/>in local extent; and as applied to the community <lb/>at large, the contentment with the law <supplied reason="copy missing">app???</supplied> to be progressive.</p>
<p>
    But symptoms of increased opposition have <lb/>lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; <lb/>I judged special interposition on my part, proper <lb/>and adviseable, and under this impression have <lb/>issued a proclamation, warning against all unlaw<lb break="no"/>ful combinations and proceedings, having for this <lb/>object, or tending to obstruct the operation of <lb/>the law in question, and announcing that all law<lb break="no"/>ful ways and means would be strictly put in ex<lb break="no"/>cution, for bring to justice the infractors there<lb break="no"/>of, and securing obedience thereto.</p>
                <p>
                    Measures have also been taken for the prosecu<lb break="no"/>tion of offenders. And Congress may be assured, <lb/>that nothing within constitutional and legal limits <lb/>which may depend on me, shall be wanting <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied><lb break="no"/>sert and maintain the just authority of the law. <lb/> In fulfilling this trust, I shall count entirely upon <lb/>the full co-operation of the other departments of <lb/>the government, and upon the zealous support of <lb/>all good citizens.</p>
                <p>I cannot forbear to bring again into the view <lb/>of the legislature the subject of a revision of the <lb/>judiciary system. A representation from the jud<lb break="no"/>ges of the supreme court, which will be laid be<lb break="no"/>fore you, points out some of the inconveniences <lb/>that are being experienced. In the course of the execu<lb break="no"/>tion of the laws, considerations rise out of the <lb/></p>
