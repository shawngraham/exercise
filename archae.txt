Creating and implementing vision statements presents challenges to organizations. They can be challenging to write because they must balance being forward-looking and describing an ideal state without becoming so idealistic that the vision is unattainable. Vision statements can be an employee dissatisfier when staff feel the company's vision is filled with business buzzwords unrelated to the company's services or when the vision does not match day-to-day company policy; for example, a vision statement that includes root cause problem solving while managers are rewarded for fixing problems quickly rather than resolving systemic issues.[2] A vision statement may need to be paired with company initiatives to communicate and reinforce the vision, ensure processes align with the vision, and empower and incentivize employees to take actions that support the company vision

Institute on Digital Archaeology Method & Practice

Archaeology is in an age where digital methods and practices are having an unavoidable impact on all areas of the discipline.  Research, teaching, compliance, preservation, public engagement, and publication – all are being transformed by digital tools and technologies.  The problem is that  there are very few opportunities for students, scholars, professional archaeologists, or closely related disciplines to build these vital digital skills. The Institute on Digital Archaeology Method & Practice hopes to address this by providing invited attendees the opportunity to receive hands-on instruction and experience in a wide variety of critical digital skills, tools, and technologies – especially those that fall outside the “traditional” suite of digital tools with which many archaeologists are already comfortable (CAD, GIS, databases, etc).
Institute Themes
The activities of the Institute for Digital Archaeological Method & Practice (lectures, workshops, etc) are organized to address a variety of themes:
Geospatial & Digital Cultural Mapping: the geospatial web, with particular emphasis on low cost or open source tools to display, visualize, share, publish, and creatively combine geospatial data for research, scholarly communication, and public engagement. Articulates with any existing “traditional” GIS experience that invited attendees may have, and draws heavily on the domain of Neogeography.
Publication and Scholarly Communication: the radically changing landscape of scholarly publishing and communication, and the ways in which archaeologists (public, private, scholarly, or student) can leverage new digital tools and platforms to build, publishing, and widely disseminate engaging archaeological “publications.”
Data, Linked Data, and Digital Libraries: digital archaeological data standards and platforms (both centralized and decentralized). Promote best practices as well as legal and technical standards for making archaeological data useful, usable, open, sharable. Methods, tools, and best practices for building digital libraries and repositories for preservation and access of archaeological materials, data, and information.
Public Outreach & Engagement: using a wide range of digital tools and techniques to engage with the public over issues of archaeological resources, preservation, and archaeological education.
3D & Augmented Reality: Low cost and low friction methods, tools, and best practices to capture and present archaeological materials in 3D for research, publication, teaching, or public engagement. Special emphasis on physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, digital imagery or geospatial data and information.
Project Development & Management: the practical, day-to-day work and intangible aspects of developing and managing digital archaeology projects. Including issues of digital archaeological project sustainability.
Pre-Institute Activities
Before arriving at Michigan State University for the first institute meeting, invites attendees will be required to create an account on Codecademy (codecademy.com) and complete (at least) the following tracks: HTML & CSS (http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web), JavaScript (http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript), Make a Website (http://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-a-website), and Make an Interactive Website (http://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-an-interactive-website). While not required, invited attendees are also encouraged to complete the PHP track (http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/php). If invited attendees already have (demonstrated) familiarity with the content covered in these tutorials, they can be excused from doing theses pre-requisite exercises. In addition to the required Codecademy tutorials, invited attendees will be provided with a pre-institute reading list that they will be required to complete before arriving at Michigan State University.
Institute Meetings
The institute will bring together 20 participants to the campus of Michigan State University for two 6 day sessions in 2015 (August 17-22) and 2016 (August 15-20). The institute meetings will be made up of lectures, hands-on workshops, and rapid development sessions on a variety of digital archaeological methods, tools, platforms, and technologies.  Invited attendees will also collaborate with one another on a series of rapid development challenges intended to allow them to apply and experiment with tools and techniques covered in other parts of the institute. In year 2, the focus of the institute will shift from structured sessions to focused work on the attendees’ projects.  Invited attendees will formally present their project so that it can be critically and constructively evaluated by invited experts (and other attendees).  Year 2 will also include focused social development session intended to provide an opportunity for attendees to further refine their projects in the company of both the returning experts as well as their fellow attendees. Year 2 will also include a series of talks and workshops focusing on topics suitable to digital projects in development. These sessions include Data Preservation, Advanced Project Management For Digital Archaeology, and  Sustaining Digital Archaeology Projects. Invited attendees will attend both institute meetings.
Interim Year, Virtual Meetings, & Online Seminars
During the period between the institute’s year 1 and year 2 meetings, attendees will work on their proposed capstone projects. They will be able to call on their mentor as needed during this period, and will be expected to post regular project updates to the institute’s website (an ongoing project diary of sorts). In addition, invited attendees will participate in a series of virtual meetings (several of which will be open to the broader public) in which participants will be expected to provide regular updates as to their project’s progress. During the interim year, the institute will also organize and host a series of web-based seminars for institute participants on digital archaeology topics. The web-based seminars will be delivered by the co-directors, institute experts, or non-institute experts. The goal of these are to provide timely discussions of new technologies, methods, and best practices germane to the institute’s focus. While these seminars will be primarily for institute participants, they will also be open to the general public (as well as being recorded and posted on the institute website).
Institute Capstone Projects
While participants will attend lectures, participate in hands-on workshops, and collaborate on small scale rapid development projects, the organizational focus is on a significant digital archaeology capstone project which attendees will be challenged to envision, design, develop, and launch during the institute. At the end of the institute’s first meeting, attendees will be expected to present a formal proposal for their capstone digital archaeology project. On the basis of that proposal, they will be matched with one of the institute’s invited experts who will act as a mentor. If the nature of the project warrants it, attendees will be matched with more than one mentor. While participants are welcome to develop their projects individually, institute staff will look for opportunities to pair participants whose projects are clearly similar in theme, content, or technology. encouraging this team-based approach is particularly important in the case of non-archaeologist participants who are less likely to come with particular project (collection, dataset, question, etc) in mind. In cases such as these, institute staff will ensure that the non-archaeologist is teamed with an archaeologist whose project they find particularly interesting or engaging. Invited attendees are also welcome to collaborate on their capstone projects with colleagues who are not attending the institute. The specific focus of the capstone projects is totally open – invited attendees are free to choose a project that interests them.  The only requirement is that the project is open and accessible to the intended audience.
An Ethos of Openness
The institute will embrace an ethos of openness.  This means that all institute materials (learning materials, videos, etc) will be made accessible to the public.  All collaborative rapid development projects built by invited attendees during the institute will be made accessible to the public. Regular project updates and blog posts written by invited attendees will by open and accessible by the public on the institute website.  Invited attendees will be strongly encouraged to use open source tools, framework, and technologies to build their capstone projects.  Where appropriate, invited attendees will be strongly encouraged to release their projects (or critical technical components of their project) under an appropriate open source license on GitHub.
