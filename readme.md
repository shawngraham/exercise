#what's going on here.

added a new repository

opened notepad. copied the code in. save as; change file type to all files, then put the extension after the name

put the canadiana.sh in it.

put jq in that directory.

installed coreutils; added coreutils to PATH

opened gitbash in that directory

ran the program - forgot that I already had wget installed, so a new user'd have to install that first.
