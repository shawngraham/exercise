humanities is also concerned with an exploration of how humanities may evolve through their engagement with technologyErnesto Priego20120101   scholarship in the humanitiesKiyonori Nagasaki20120101   Humanities as a whole is something I am extremely reluctant to define because any definition will inevitably cause controversy However I have not heard any dispute over my work being part of

umbrella term for something like the use of technology to study human cultures and the study of the effects of   technology on human cultures Today I would add that  has (or should have) a selfconscious reflection on the technical aspects of these endeavours whether that means acquiring and making use of the programming skills to produce new tools for   study of human culture examining the methodological problems of using these tools or theorising the way their underlying technologies affect human society and the material objects of human culture That said I am worried that the theorising of the   Humanities the development of infrastructure to support the   Humanities and the opportunity of exploiting the big data sphere of the internet are collectively having the effect of marginalising the study of traditional objects of study in the Humanities particularly those of the more distant pastScott Kleinman20120101 The   humanities is about creating people Creating people

developed and where new ways of looking at and preforming researching become possible Most of all it is fun Fun because it is challenging each day every dayDavid Beavan20120101 As I siad on my blog:   Humanities is the discipline born from the intersection between humanities scholarship and computational technologies It aims at investigating how   methodologies can be used to enhance research in disciplines such a History Literature Languages Art History Music Cultural Studies and many others   Humanities holds a very strong practical component as it includes the concrete creation of   resources for the study of specific disciplinesElena Pierazzo20120101   Humanities mean to me more now than it did back in 2009 when I first did the Day of DH  offers a set of tools to pose humanistic inquiry but it doesn't necessarily offer definitive answers to those questions Instead it celebrates and records a process of intellectual pursuit that is then distributed and disseminated to the Humanities community and abroad Engaging in   Humanities is also an ethos: collaboration building knowledge sharing projects screwing around I apply this to my scholarship as well as my teaching If my work is better more complex because of   Humanities so too will my students' work benefit from the tools state of mind and ethosKatherine D Harris20120101 The practice of combining emerging   tools

first step towards Future HumanitiesDavor20120101 I view the   Humanities as a constantly changing field which escapes easy definition  this is has benefits but also presents challenges! Standard definitions talk about the application of information technology to humanities teaching and research  whether that be to develop better ways of doing things or to create new questions and paradigms  but I think that the field also has a key role in articulating how technology is changing scholarshipPaul Spence20120101   Humanities is the combination of using   techniques to better understand and present our understanding of the Humanities It is about the dissemination of our work the sharing of knowledge and collaborating to give the best possible chance to a project   Humanities is about the Community about learning constantly evolving and being open to new ways of thinking about old questions It is not as a friend asked about building   humansNatasha Martin20120101 I would define   Humanities as a term used to identify persons practices ideologies etc that conform to institutional and scholarly values as determined by individual and institutional norms But I would distinguish the definition of  from doing   humanities work (theoretical practical critical) which means something much more Doing   humanities means challenging the institutionalization of humanistic inquiry in fact it means responding to the crippling institutionalization of emotive responses to humanistic practices within the public sphere of all “knowledge workers” To do this means that we must build tools technologies methodologies and theories that represent this disruptive force but we must also put what we build into practice It is not longer enough to present (or represent) an idea a tool we must do the work of the community and we must engage the community in developing the ways in which we make our (our as in humanity) work accessible (this means disability studies needs to become a stronger focus of our scholarship and our practices) We must as Alan Liu argued practice being the service community that we have always wanted to becomeShawn W Moore20120101 I think I said last year that I dislike that question and that remains the case Its boundaries are continually shifting and elude satisfactory definition Even something as simple as 'Using computers for teaching and research in the Humanities' can have caveats I recognise why a definition of  might be desirable but still: I dislike the questionJustin Tonra20120101

not clearly defined The   Humanities take advantage of applying mathematical methods for the analysis of cultural phenomenaMarkus Schnoepf20120101 For me   humanities is thinking through making as

Humanities workKirstyn Leuner20120101 '  humanities' is a gathering term for scholars who embrace technology as a means to explore humanities material as dataRobin Davis20120101 What it really comes down to is what are people doing to contribute to an understanding of the   age or what are they doing to expand the practices and work of humanities fields using current technology A person is not a   Humanist by mistake They are not a   Humanist simply because they use a computer to do their work nor are they a   Humanist simply by virtue of working in a humanities field and being able to program What is the methodological framework for their work? For example using JuXta for collation on a new edition of a novel for the sake of efficiency does not make that edition a  project but writing about how the use of JuXta changes the way that we create scholarly editions of literature would fall into the  field Essentially whether or not a person is trying to engage with DH whether in theory or in practice determines whether or not they are a   Humanisttesshab20120101 It's the sum of a lot of separate activities involving doing humanities research and using computers at more or less the same time and with at least an intermittent element of

humanities is a scholarly enterprise which encompasses a field of study a set of tools a methodological approach and a global community among other things   humanists examine the objects of humanistic study – literature history art language and so forth – using   tools to carry out the kind of analysis that would be very difficult or impossible to do without the use of technology Where the value of   humanities lies however is not in the powerful capabilities of the   tools themselves – as impressive as these may be – but rather in the way that the analyses and visualizations produced by the technology are combined with the skills of critical interpretation nuanced close analysis and attentiveness to ambiguity which are born out of a deep grounding in socalled conventional humanities studyAnouk Lang20120101 I guess I define  as twofold : Using technology to do Humanities Research and doing Humanities research about Technology Plus a commitment to the openness of knowledge Plus a

have come to think about the   humanities as an umbrella term for a few different things These include the development of tools and software for research teaching and scholarship In this case every part of the development process and use of these tools is potentially  scholarship I would also include the use of any   tools and software for interpretation and analysis on humanities research questions Beyond this I would include any work that involves challenging the traditional roles of scholarship and scholarly communication For example using blogs to communicate with broader audiences Lastly I would suggest that new media studies that is studies of born   objects is inherently a subset of work in the   humanities In short any situation in which the idea of the   touches or engages with work in the humanitiesTrevor Owens20120101 HumanitiesMartin Holmes20120101 I define   Humanities as that which lies on the continuum that began in orality and moved through literate or printbased

As an experienced manager and ICT consultant my approach towards  is practical For me  is about interconnecting researchers (and their collections) software developers and infrastructure providers As a researcher my aim is different Then  is about bringing central questions about the nature of the humanities to light But now I believe   Humanities is coming of age And in my opinion   Humanities has become an intrinsic part of the Humanities Therefore   Humanities is the same as the HumanitiesDouwe Zeldenrust20120101 To my mind   Humanities is a twopronged discipline: 1   Humanists study the ways in which new technologies and new media impact on traditional humanities disciplines on human interaction society and communication 2   Humanists develop tools and resources for humanities students and scholars to further studies in the humanities and the social sciences but also to allow for new research questions as new data and tools to examine this data become availableChristine

Rehberger20120101 Though I think '  Humanities' can mean a wide range of things depending on who's defining it I define it (usually in lowercase) as an area of study that focuses on the intersection of technology and humanistic research That's the bare bones of it But really in practice (or in Praxis in my case as in the Praxis Program at UVa  get it?)  is a wild carefree romp through the worlds of coding design project management data analysis and much more in order to rethink and reappropriate traditional methodologies of humanities scholarship and researchBrooke Lockwood Lestock20120101 While I endorse all the work done under the rubric of   Humanities I am actually not a fan of the term I feel that the term is used to define a political move within academia that is focused on the privileging of certain technologies and technological approaches over the greater epistemological questions that define the humanities and its constituent disciplines As someone who has to work with people who may be wary of   technology in their teaching research and publishing practice I find that insinuating that '  humanities' is in some way essentially different from general humanities alienates the unfamiliar and more deeply entrenches the already conservative I believe that an approach that considers the incorporation of these technologies as part of a continuum in the ongoing impact of technology on academic work that predates the   and not as a political paradigmatic shift better reminds us that scholarship is centrally focused on the answering of questions about the unknown with whatever tools are at our disposal The   shouldn't really matter in the name and we should think about incorporating this approach to scholarship across all work and not a subset of research The work is good and important the term I find more problematic and rarely if ever use to define my work or the work we do at my institutionKimon Keramidas20120101 To reconsider the

humanities is just one method for conducting humanistic inquiry Doing research in the humanities often boils down to finding a patternin a single text or across several textsand then providing an interpretation of that pattern In   humanities computation is used to assist in pattern recognition pulling out patterns that would be difficult for humans to find unassisted Interpretation of that pattern however remains the most important part of the processBrian Croxall20120101 Using computers to analyse humanities materials and subjects or the critical contemplation of using   technologies

traditional study methods would not easily pinpoint This new approach can also speed up the process of information retrieval acting as a supplement to traditional studies and enhancing our overall understanding of the humanitiesRyan E Simmons20120101 The “  humanities” is an umbrella term that describes how humanities scholars are using   tools to inform approach and present their research and

humanities scholarshipElijah Meeks20120101 In a recent article on Inside Higher Ed Steve Kolowich defines '  humanities' as 'a branch of scholarship that takes the computational rigor that has long undergirded the sciences and applies it to the study of history language art and culture' To this (and other definitions of   humanities) I would add that the   humanities must also consider the interface between   and analog culture between the pixels of our computer screens and the printed text of bound books What we do online has little meaning if it isn't linked (literally or figuratively) to embodied practice What we are online only exists insofar as it is connected to what we are in the fleshJesse Stommel20120101   Humanities as I have understood it this semester is the idea or goal in the process of creating something new I would define   Humanities as the idea of integrating and analyzing technical/computational material and create activities with humanistic studies Basically it's understanding the material deeper One activity we did for example this semester was reading the stories of Sherlock Holmes To understand the story better with  we used a tool called the Voyant website On there we were able to explore more of the stories depth such as discovering which words are used more than others also creating charts and graphs and etc We were also fortunate to watch the TV series 'Sherlock' to understand the story and actual characters a bit more Another activity was when reading the novel 'Ms Dalloway' which consists of text on paper with D we did a mapping project of each of the character's main movements and sightseeing It made it seem as if we could actually see where they went every day in real life using Google earth Basically I would say   humanities is the process of going further within the research to find that hidden quality that you couldn't see on the surface and create something new with itLexie20120101 Humanities +   =

simple however   technologies change the way we do work They change the way we compose and revise even when we are writing for print publication They also afford us new ways to distribute and publish our work and how we can analyze and manipulate information More radically however   technologies change the way we organize and perceive the world which leads us to ask new questions and adopt new ideologies For instance the rise of open access scholarship Creative Commons licenses and remix culture are all breaks from the ideologies of print culturejohnpwalter20120101   humanities for me is

creation of new electronic environments for access to traditional or born  materials It is the study of ways of thinking differently about how we know what we know and how the interpretive task of the humanist is redefined in these changed conditions' (xii) What resonates with me about Drucker’s definition is how she conceives of  both in terms of its epistemological function and in terms of its function for us as critics—and I will add to her definition as teachers as wellLauren Klein20110101 Une pratique réflexive des outils numériques en sciences humaines et socialesBjörnOlav Dozo20110101

humanities: development of multimedia pedagogies and scholarship designing & building tools human computer interaction designing & building archives etc  is interdisciplinary by necessity it breaks down boundaries between disciplines at the local (eg English and history) and global (eg humanities and computer sciences) levelsKathie Gossett20110101 I see '  Humanities' as an umbrella term for two different but related developments:1) Humanities Computing (the specialist use of computing technology to undertake Humanities research) and 2) the implications for the Humanities of the social

of information (both print and nonprint) in   environment   humanities investigate how   media affect the disciplines in which they are used In practice we are constantly redefining not only the concept of humanities computing but also of computing itself In this manner we come to understand how these disciplines when recalibrated for a   environment contribute to our knowledge of computing

of   objects and practices to create and study in the humanities broadly defined In that sense it is a specialization that cuts across disciplinary boundaries to the work of   humanists in other disciplines It is also the insistence that the humanities comes to understand the implications of its assumption that only print technologies exist and it is the insistence that the humanities learns that no technology is invisible natural or inevitable and that someday all humanists will be   A few will specialize in print chirographic or oralculture humanitiesSharon Cogdill20110101 I think   humanities like social media is an idea that will increasingly become invisible as new methods and platforms move from being widely used to being ubiquitous For now   humanities defines the overlap

umbrella term for some recent trends in the humanities: amongst others collaborative working and writing data driven research and visualization Very often the current discussions on  are discussions of delimitations and demarcations One of the main questions is  imho  if  should be either an integrated part of the humanities or else be some kind of an auxiliary discipline (in the field of History in German we have the expression 'Historische Hilfswissenschaften')Peter Haber20110101   Humanities involves the effort to consider how our human capabilities and capacities are developing or being challenged by and through   media  Those scholars and practitioners who locate themselves within   humanities view themselves as interdisciplinary collaborators who want to work together to enhance opportunities for individuals and groups traditionally marginalized from the centers of power We therefore see our task as a critical and productive one pressing back against the tides of efficiency and busyness that are leading people to view themselves merely as earners and consumers rather than as human creators and participantsLynn Schofield Clark20110101 I don't know that defining   humanities has any useful purpose though the act of defining marks   humanities with the attribute of scholarly inquiry A humanist with an interest in   things is I hope still a humanist one who defines the self by interest in varieties of human expression If one's interest is   things then one must achieve some form of   literacy to do useful scholarly things If one's interest is humanities one must think about how   technology reshapes one's interaction with traditionaland newobjects of humanist studiesWesley Raabe20110101 I would define it as the  intersection between computing

teaching and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities (Wikipedia) and The   humanities are just the humanities of the present moment (Alex Reid: http://wwwalexreidnet/) I find those two definitions  one very inclusive and dry and the other thoughtprovoking but equally inclusive  to be productive and useful To work in  is to be curious about

technologies is changing and challenging the ways historians practice their craft The way we collect present and store information has changed rapidly in the last twenty years   history is several things: a methodology meant to aid the traditional art and practice of historians the use of   tools to gain insight into information that cannot be done with a legal pad and pen allows historians to disseminate and present their information in new ways and a means to reach wide audiences through   technologies The goal isn’t cliometrics 20 or to augment the theorydriven social sciences but to abide by the historian's commitment to complexity and nuance while utilizing   technologies to aid that taskJason Heppler20110101 Humanities is humanities   or not  the study of literature fine arts history language and philosophy  We don't distinguish   sociology or   astronomy so why   humanities?  Just because computers are involved doesn't mean the basic nature of the subject area is any different than it has been been traditionally   Computers allow for doing things with texts and other cultural artifacts that could not be done feasibly without the computational power and storage modern computers provide   Computers should be considered an extension of the scholar's mind  very useful

 humanities is whatever we make it to beGeorge H Williams20110101 The   Humanities is both a field with a discernable set of academic lineages practices and methodologies and a vague umbrella term used to describe the application of   technology to traditional humanistic inquiry Ultimately what sets  apart from many other humanities fields is its methodological commitment to building things as a way of knowingMatthew K Gold20110101 something borrowed something newBrad Brace20110101 The   humanities quite simply is doing humanities work with   media Though much has been made about   media like video games threatening the kind of book learning that humanists do many of the same critical problems and questions we have been working on for centuries still apply and can be used to read these new media forms Furthermore these   tools can be leveraged to help us do this kind of intellectual labor So   humanities includes both doing humanities on   objects and using   objects to do humanitiesTimothy Welsh20110101  is all about freedom  Humanity is the producing animal (Marx) or the symbolusing animal (Kenneth Burke)   The humanities have always studied what people create in the realm of freedom  The whole point of putting things in the   realm is the freedom it gives us to turn the physical into symbols that we can manipulate as freely as in a video game   You might not find anyone in the academy more concerned with freedom than   humanistsAlan Bilansky20110101 The use of information technology and software with humanities source materials to pursue research

if you're lucky you might spot your reflection in it then again all you might see is darkness And if you feel compelled to step in it don't be surprised if you slip  Those stains will not come outEric Forcier20110101 If someone asks I refer them to Matthew Kirschenbaum's What is   Humanities and What’s it Doing in English Departments? in the ADE Bulletin (2010) That said I would emphasize the long tradition of humanities computing going back to Roberto Busa's work at leastalthough I'm unsure how precisely it relates to the current frenzy of activityAllen Riddell20110101   humanities is the intersection of work in the humanities (research teaching writing) with technology (tools networks interactions) when the practitioner is consciously exploring a humanistic subject and a technological method at the same timeElli Mylonas20110101   Humanities is the integration of sophisticated empirical techniques utilizing tools and technologies typically associated with practical sciences into the study of traditional humanities questions  It represents a more exploratory and less quantitative approach than social sciences in the use of such tools but it also represents ambitious attempts to model nuanced human wisdom in ways that like early flying machines are beautiful quite impractical and often failElijah Meeks20110101 The application of computing technology to the humanities *and* the critical investigation of the human use of this technologyJohn Levin20110101 The   humanities is a name claimed by a community of those interested in   methodologies and/or content in the humanitiesRebecca Davis20110101   Humanities means taking full advantage of current and emerging technologies to support conceptualizations of learning history that stress developing inquiry skills

ly both data sets and research findings   is more a community of practice than a specific set of methods and procedures  Thus  encourages ongoing collaboration and its practitioners are committed to making Humanities research extensible (or at least they ought to be)   is by nature interdisciplinary and so provides a practical means to integrate research data and methodologies from more than just one humanities disciplineJames Ginther20110101   Humanities is the deliberate critical application of emerging technology to the study of traditional subjects such as literature art philosophy and language often (but not always) with a focus on how those traditional fields are now using emerging technology We are deliberate and critical when we foreground the study of our own   tools (for example the forwardthinking   humanist prefers the opensource tool to the proprietary one) We apply technology because we must participate in   culture in order to understand it Full participation in   culture means contributing to (creating) the cultural economy not simply observing (consuming)Dennis Jerz20110101   Humanities is the intersection of humanities studies with the   world This intersection just keeps getting bigger as more people do more things  ly and invent more ways that we can answer questions using computersAlice Hickcox20110101 My lawyer advises me not to answer this question But I have written a few thoughts on my blog http://wwwstanfordedu/~mjockers/cgibin/drupal ode/43Matthew Jockers20110101  is a multidiscipline through which criticism analysis and speculation is focused on the past present and future of the human conditionRichard Cunningham20110101   Humanities is a term that refers to materiality  I am a writer and a   artist which means that ultimately my material is language  The   half of   humanities simply indicates how that language is executed    Humanities is not an obscure field  It describes the art of the present by looking at new and familiar modes of representationErin Costello20110101 Dan Cohen offers a fair definition (http://bitly/gVUpV7) with which I wholeheartedly agree Of course institutionally it often makes more sense to describe it as a discipline (when offering a course in  for example or in organizing a conference) but I feel that these are rather more like contingent not essential (if there can be such a thing) characterizationsArno Bosse20110101 Fairly broadly: the use of technology in communicating discussing thinking about the humanitiesLarry Swain20110101 The   Humanities is not just technology people and not just traditional humanistic scholars It should include anyone interested in   pedagogy and scholarship with a humanistic ethic They might work under the hood behind the technological screen or out front on the stage making it possible to collect and analyze the changing relationships of all agents involved in determining the human condition in the 21st centuryDickie Selfe20110101   Humanities is the acknowledgement that human creativity is for the moment deeply entangled with our technological tools and networks The media extensions cannot be separated from our realityAnastasia

to investigate in new ways the primary materials (text image sound object) with which humanities scholars are concerned A field of engagement in which technology textuality and humanities convergeAndrew Prescott20110101 The   humanities is a blanket term for many different types of activities For researchers I believe it is a philosophy that there are answers to questions that cannot be answered without the aid of machines For exhibitors it is a belief that computers can be used to enhance the visitor experience For all it is an understanding that while our own minds may have limits that need not limit what we can do or knowAdam Crymble20110101 the application of information computing and communication technologies to humanities questions problems or dataEthan Watrall20110101   Humanities is the application of   tools to the work of humanists and the creation of humanist works in the   realm  Its applications encompass research and teachingAaron Gulyas20110101 For me it's a number of different things It might be humanistic research that incorporates   tools the act of building a   archive or scholarly edition finding new ways of displaying research or involving an audience in the research process or building new tools for humanistic inquiryMiriam Posner20110101  is the umbrella that shelters critical hackers and theorists of the hack from the vitriol of analog hacksAlex Colibri20110101 The application of computing and webbased tools in Humanities researchAnne Welsh20110101   Humanities is increasingly just Humanities  as far as I'm concerned New tools lead to new methodologies new perspectives and new questions that all humanists should be aware of and concerned withBenjamin Albritton20110101 I understand  as the iterative design and application of   research and teaching tools to meet the realworld needs of living breathing humans This could include students (I'll be working on a pilot   writing assessment study that day) or cultural stakeholders (I'll also be working on a longterm project involving the design of a   archive for cultural stakeholders)Jim Ridolfo20110101 To borrow someone else's words it's an intersection of technology and Humanities and uses the brains of people across disciplines  subsets (text mining data mining mashups) can allow scholarship to flourish in ways we never thought

heritageMeagan Timney20110101 The study and practice of using technology for humanitiesbased research teaching and collaborationJana Remy20110101 At its core the   Humanities is the use of   tools to gather organize analyze and present scholarly research in the humanities Humanists seek to understand the world and cultures in which people live and have lived through a variety of disciplines including literature English and other modern languages philosophy art art history and history While many of the questions humanists seek to answer have not changed new technology like text mining dynamic visualizations and spatial analysis provide humanists ways to ask new questions and view old questions differentlyBrian Sarnacki20110101 The   Humanities are awesome! We're seeing increased crosspollination between fields like writing and science literature and computers history and engineering Plus there are so many new interactive tools that allow us to (re)discover ideas in a new way!Kim Lacey20110101 Which is to say I don't know what it is but I know it when I see itShawn Graham20110101 All disciplines that are used to study human knowledge and culture are known as Humanities   Humanities are all those same subjects conducted by using   tools to expand human knowledge and culture To understand how we expand our knowledge and culture though   tools As an example Sociology that is classified within Humanities if it studies social behavior relationships and communications between different users on a network we could talk about   SociologyPaz Tornero20110101 For me   Humanities explores how and whether we can apply technology to our experience of history heritage and culture  questions how technology changes the environment around us physical and   and discusses whether those changes are for the better I believe the concept of   humanities is much more then just humanities computing as society becomes increasingly   it become a way of life and it is important to understand how and why that is happeningClaire Ross20110101 The scholarly study and use of computers and computer culture to illuminate the human record (BUSA remix)Ernesto Priego20110101 As mentioned above to me the key aspects of   Humanities are the digitisation of materials and their dissemination to the general public Work in this field needs to be outward focussed as much as it is focussed on the furthering of research The nature of the   age is that information can be readily shared that research can take on a far more collaborative nature and this approach is of importance to all areas of academic study including the humanities Presentation functionality and ease of use are in my opinion as important as the content of   archives in all disciplinesDaniel Burt20110101 Innovative uses of   tools to do the work of the humanitiesDoug Reside20110101 I was a computer programmer long before I was a 'professional' humanist I think in terms of efficient processes and scalable systems This has interesting results sometimes when I think about historical research  To me   humanities is most usefully defined as the thing humanities can become when we aren't limited by the ability of a lone mind or even the ability of a group of human minds alone to detect patterns and analyze evidenceTara L Andrews20110101 For me but this is very specific   Humanities is to interconnect humanities researchers software developers and infrastructure providers in order to contribute to the research and the research possibilties in this disciplineDouwe Zeldenrust20110101   Humanities is a term used to define the technical evolutionary aspect of modern humanities scholarship   Humanities seeks to take advantage of new modes of technologically enabled scholarship to ensure the contemporaneous relevance and future preservation of classical traditional and historical modes and approaches of scholarship native to the humanitiesMichael J Maguire20110101 Humanities by   meansFranz Fischer20110101 With extreme reluctanceLou Burnard20110101   libraries are a great example of an outcome of   Humanities The interaction and combination of the new   era with history librarianship literature etc gives a wider frame for researchers of all different branches to work in Now the full texts of important writers are just a click away!Ines Jerele20110101 I think that increasingly there is a little of the   in almost all research in the humanities This makes   Humanities much harder to define but it makes it more relevant than ever   Humanities is technical and it is also highly theoretical For this reason as   technologies help to enhance research in the humanities the humanities are also helping us to better understand the implications of the  20110101   Humanities is as far as I am concerned an opportunity for the Humanities to participate in and help help develop understandings of the spead of   technologiesGareth Beale20110101 The   humanities study how   media (formats and tools) and the cultural forms associated with them affect the work of the humanities  and vice versaLewis Ulman20110101   Humanities is the application of computer technology to make intellectual inquiries in the humanities that either could not be made using traditional methods or are made significantly faster and easier with computer technology It can include both using   tools to make these inquiries or developing these tools for others to useMatthew Zimmerman20110101  is anything that combines imagining planning building and creating using a   medium with language literature history philosophy art music etc Anyone comfortable with a computer and interested in the humanities probably participates in   Humanities whether formally (with support from a fellowship or institution with a planned and mediated project) or informally (through compiling notes and information in multimedia form) We have as much to learn from the informal processes as the formalJasmine Mulliken20110101 I work in   literary studies and archives primarily so I think about   humanities in terms of the interactions between texts of various sorts and a wide array of   environments While my work is focused in this way I generally conceive of  as a field interested in the intersections between humanitiesbased research and teaching and computing technologies and literacies This would include the humanities which take artistic production as their subject but also the fine arts and performative practicesJacqueline Wernimont20110101   Humanities is a critical investigation and practice of the methods of humanities research in the   mediumJulia Flanders20110101   humanities is a metafield a set of coevolving new knowledge and best practices expanding from traditional humanities disciplines into born  research and teaching methods   humanists study all objects and practices of concern to analog humanities plus those made possible by the   age   humanists also build tools that make it possible for themselves their students and the world at large to engage critically with our cultural heritageVika Zafrin20110101 I don't define   Humanities any more All humanities seems to be   in one way or anotherMartin Holmes20110101 I don't: I'm sick of trying to define it When forced to I'll make the referent the people instead of the ideas or methods    Humanities is the thing practiced by people who selfidentify as   Humanists It's helpful to have a name for the field chiefly for institutional authority Though granted I think it does involve coding / making / building / doing things with computers things related to you know the humanitiesAmanda French20110101 I like to define   Humanities as a set of new activities for humanists instead of a field of study because   Humanities involve something more than a methodology or an interest on a topic Implies a complete different attitude towards humanities the understanding use and creation of new tools and a alternative way to communicate the findings This is something that involves you completelyErnesto Priani20110101   Humanities is a way to ask redefine and answer questions with a more intelligent set of toolsLik Hang Tsui20110101   humanities integrates the acquisition of knowledge through research methods as well as the expression of intellectual material through emergent technologies and media  This is achieved through technologies (ie mobile devices wireless access and  ization) and online platforms (ie social media Web 20 applications and other emergent media)  Together these invite a new epistemological way to know and investigate our worldClaire Menck20110101 The utilization of technologies to help increase the level/types of research The dissemination of said systems to communities involved in the use of humanities resources and the study of systems design theories as applied within the realm of humanitiesAlberto Martinez20110101   Humanities are the application and the use of computing tecnologies for the research teaching and investigation in the disciplines of the humanitiesAli Albarran20110101 for me   Humanities is the filed where the information is delivered in an electronic form to an audience in the humanities field today the delivery of the information in an electronic form almost has no boundaries One could easily send a message to one or multiple recipients just from his email account posting on a blog or simply from his Facebook account (posting a Wall status update) The users around the world are all interconnected together and regardless if one chose to send a message from his yahoo account to an AOL one that is totally possible as now all the separated networks (eg AOL Yahoo) are connected under one umbrella: The Internet Before one AOL user was able to send a message just to the members from his network (AOL) Today the technical developments made possible that everybody could be connected in real time to anyone else The information in electronic form can be transmitted not just to those proficient in computing science but also to those interested in modem languages law or arts The capability and easiness of how the   information can be transmitted/shared/used not just between and to computing science  related individuals but also to humanities related ones is the core of the   humanities fieldDan Manolescu20110101   Humanities is to me the use and abuse of technology to potential improve study within the field of humanities It stretches from a simple blog to complex corpus tools to whatever the next person can think ofChris20110101   humanities uses computers software and the web to enable and publish the ever new work of humanities scholarsOrla Murphy20110101   Humanities is the interaction interrelation and intersection of technology culture language and literatureEdmond Chang20110101 I think it's a convenient label but fundamentally I don't believe in it There are people who haven't yet attempted to come to grips with how   tools and methods can change research teaching and outreach in the Humanities and these are those who have The latter are   Humanities types  But it's all WissenschaftHugh Cayless20110101 Development and application of specialist   resources for research in the humanitiesDavid Robey20110101  fosters the evolution of scholarship engenders collaboration and dialogue and widens access and participation across the arts and humanities (and the MLA sector) via the application of   methods and techniquesPaul Vetch20110101   Humanities is an interdisciplinary area that may include the application of methodologies and research agendas from computer science and other informaticsheavy and quantitative sciences to the subject area of traditional humanities disciplines such as literature history and languagesGabriel Bodard20110101 My definition is an expansive/ecumenical one I see   Humanities as an umbrella concept bringing together all of the different ways in which the computer and especially the internet have transformed humanities work It includes using computer methods to mark and analyze analog humanities products adapting the distinctive features of the World Wide Web for the production and presentation of humanities research and bringing humanities methods to the evaluation of the entirely new genres of expression made possible by computersJohn Theibault20110101 I am currently using a short definition which is that   Humanities is a combination of using computer technologies to study human cultures and studying the effect of computer technologies on human culturesScott Kleinman20110101   Humanities involves the mining of sources using new media tools so we can interrogate the past with new questionsJames GR Cronin20110101 A creative ongoing fest where everybody is invited but in which only a small bunch of techno people participates!Paule Mackrous20110101 I hate this question and I don't have an answer for it Neither it seems does a large portion of the people who might be called   Humanists I'll leave it at thatJustin Tonra20110101 For this project we are going for the broadest definition of   Humanities the interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the impact and relationship of computing and the Humanities By  projects we are seeking to document websites databases tools digitilization projects CDs and so forth that have been created to aid and support humanities research We are aware that some  projects can ovelap with   libraries or teaching aids and   learning objectsIsabel Galina20110101  mixes computing technologies and new media literacy with traditional fields in humanities making use of accumulated information It is a multidisciplinary field and so very hard to contain within traditional boundaries Both  and design are complex playgrounds maybe that's why designers love to be part of  projectsCarlos Fiorentino20110101 The theorizing developing and application of/on computational techniques to humanities subjectsEdward Vanhoutte20110101 Broadly construed   humanities is the use of   media and technology to advance the full range of thought and practice in the humanities from the creation of scholarly resources to research on those resources to the communication of results to colleagues and studentsDan Cohen20110101 I define   humanities loosely as the use of computers and the Internet to advance research teaching and scholarly communication in the humanities as well the study of computing's significance for the humanities Many activities would fall under this definition including building tools and collections using tools and collections to discern patterns in humanities data communicating the results of humanities research through multimodal and/or interactive publications linking together classes using social networking technologies and analyzing the significance of networked culture I also define   humanities by its community and its ethos which I view as being committed to openness experimentation collegiality transdisciplinarity public knowledge and innovationLisa Spiro20110101 The   Humanities are  – or should be – a movement in the Humanities that aims to design develop promote and use   tools to support work – academic or not – in the various disciplines of the Humanities It strongly encourages benefits from and contributes to interdisciplinary practices including beyond the Humanities I hope that these practices will soon be so natural to the Humanities that they won’t need to be qualified   anymoreSegolene Tarte20110101 I define   Humanities as a praxis and also as a field and in this way it reminds me of Romanticism also a praxis and a field in my opinion As a practice  involves making and/or thinking about   objects or entities that participate in or contribute to Humanities disciplines As a field it perhaps includes the growing body of electronic literary texts (either eborn or bookborn) and archival projects as well as theory and criticism related to   technologies I'm sure I'm leaving something out but this is a startKirstyn Leuner20110101 Studying what makes us tick using   resourcesElton Barker20110101 The   humanities is what   humanists do  What   humanists do depends largely on academic discipline but also on level of technical expertise  Each discipline with varying degrees of intensity has over the years developed a set of favored methods tools and interests that although shared with other disciplines remains connected to the discipline  The task of the   humanities as a transcurricular practice is to bring these practitioners into communication with each other and to cultivate a discourse that captures the shared praxis of bringing technologies of representation computation and communication to bear on the work of interpretation that defines the humanitiesRafael

in the Human Sciences thought with the transformation of our relationship to textuality This   turn happens in the context of a crisis in the Human sciences first a financial crises but also an institutional and politic one even if it is softer in Switzerland In this context the 'Humanités  es' – a label diversely interpreted – offer the opportunity to think again our ways of building and transmitting knowledge The  are at the same time a practice and a problematic They include not only the sum total of the   technologies applied to the Human sciences but eminently the questioning on the modifications provoked by these technologies from the point of view of the training et of the knowledge transmission in the Human sciencesClaire Clivaz20110101 The development of new   methodologies that combined with traditional humanities methodologies expands the kinds of research that humanists can do in their own field and in interdisciplinary projectsKalani Craig20110101 For me the   humanities encompasses teaching and scholarship based around a commitment to building Building doesn't necessarily mean coding For me building means understanding and critically analyzing how artifacts (writing music film even houses arguments and groups of people) are put together with the intention of being able to produce something out of the mass of objects and relations that make up our worldRoger Whitson20110101 I think   humanities is an unfortunate neologism largely because the humanities itself is a problematic term The biggest problem is that the tent isn't big enough! I have participated in a number of  events and they are strikingly similar to things like Science Online20110101 With that said  is at its best when it embraces the   not simply as a means to the traditional ends of scholarship but when it transforms the nature of what humanists do The   allows for scholars librarians archivists and curators to engage much more directly with each other and the public Further it allows them not simply to write for each other but to build things for everyoneTrevor Owens20110101   Humanities to me is any activity that engages computational media to develop and explore ideas relevant to our understanding of literature and cultureSigi Jottkandt20110101 The performance of humanities related activities in through and with   mediaChristopher Long20110101 A

isolated people jointly concerned about the materiality of   surrogates the virtual qualities of physical relationships between avatars and the creation of their own simulated utopiaAlejandro Giacometti20110101   Humanities at least for me is an extension of the root Arts and Humanities disciplines My experience tells me that computing and technology has led to many new resources and even more answers to research questions Crucially it's allowed the researchers I've worked closely with to ask new previously unimaginable questions   Humanities is a culture a way of thinking a new set of methods and a new set of collaborationsDavid Beavan20110101 Good question to which there is no good answer but rather just more questions My own interpretation is quite broad but there are two ways of seeing  which interest me  one is generous and encompasses all work combining humanities research and   tools and methodology etc and the other would be rather narrower in definition reflecting on the specific contribution which 'the  ' can make to humanities scholarship and on the 'new scholarship' which develops as a resultPaul Spence20100101 A field of study that looks at the application of   technology to the research areas of the humanities  It is not necessarily undertaking that humanities research but examining the methodology and provision of possibilities for enabling that research or new conceptions of related research The majority of work in this area however gets characterised by those outside the field as IT professionals just doing a bit of programming work for them while uselessly banging on about longterm preservation formats open data and not really doing real researchJames Cummings20100101 In a world dominated by   technology  is an attempt to let humanists catch up with the latest computing advances understand them criticize them and eventually be able to determine their evolution 'from the inside' In terms of a research program though  is still largely undefined We are still in the 'understanding and criticizing' phase with only few people moving towards a truly 'creative' phase We're pulled by the latest technologies developed within the other computing fields hardly pushing back into these fields our own research results for they are often perceived as too simplistic or not generic enoughMichele Pasin20100101 I define the   humanities as a methodology and as a field  I don't see it as the logical telos of the humanities computing tradjectory but rather as a parallel or sucessive movement The   humanities is a beautiful convergence of individuals interested in humanities scholarship design born  objects technology and its impact on society as well as contemporary history and cultureDana Solomon20100101   humanities is the synthesis of technical competencies in computing with critical thinking in fields such as history literary criticism cultural studies textual studies and information managementJentery Sayers20100101 A decade ago the humanities comprised academic disciplines that were most easily named by reference to the rules governing the American National Endowment for the Humanities   tools have and are breaking down the distinctions among those disciplines as well as between the traditional 'humanities' and other fieldsthe arts for example   tools are encouraging collaborative and open research   tools are forcing us to rethink our definition of academic   tools are redefining 'scholar'   tools may be pointing the way toward new ways of contemplation and contribution The   humanities is both a force for and a record of the ongoing changesWilliam Allen20100101 The interaction between two world that cannot anymore be considered separatelyEnrica Salvatori20100101 One upon a time a Humanist found a

The   humanities are a diverse area of potential research and inquiry ranging from applying humanities scholarship to computing problems (and vice versa computing scholarship to humanities problems) to the more cultural and philosophical ideas surrounding our technology influenced worldAli Grotkowski20100101   humanities is the utilization of   technologies and methods that influence how I practice my craft in the humanities It is directed by the theories about how we engage in various technologies to learn in the humanities As a historian I seek to understand how museums and archives engage with   tools and to understand how individuals utilize such tools to learn about the pastBrenda M Trofanenko20100101   Humanities is a difficult concept to define for me  explores how and whether we can apply technology to our experience of history heritage and culture  questions how technology changes the environment around us physical and   and discusses whether those changes are for the better I believe the concept of   humanities is much more then just humanities computing as society becomes increasingly   it become a way of life and it is important to understand how and why that is happeningClaire Rosslege20100101 The convergence of computing and humanities scholarship and practices for the purpose of finding new approaches to the study of a given topicCraig

related technologies to enable the creation and sharing of humanities scholarship in ways not possible in traditional humanities practice   Humanities challenges traditional understandings of the Humanities by fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and providing new perspectives on the objects of humanistic inquiryJason Boyd20100101   Humanities is the deliberate critical application of emerging technology to the study of traditional subjects such as literature art philosophy and language often (but not always) with a focus on how those traditional fields are now using emerging technology We are deliberate and critical when we foreground the study of our own   tools (for example the forwardthinking   humanist prefers the opensource tool to the proprietary one) We apply technology because we must participate in   culture in order to understand it Full participation in   culture means contributing to (creating) the cultural economy not simply observing (consuming)Dennis Jerz20100101 There's no way to divide humanities from its   basis just as there was no way of separating the humanities from their previous (still alive) analog medium the paper We

also be called local knowledge managementJoel C Yuvienco20100101 Using computers to advance scholarship in the humanitiesJohn Lavagnino20100101 The most concise way that I've defined humanities computing is: a   component for disciplines in the humanities Humanities Computing works towards answering 'yes' to questions in the nature of  is this possible? The definition of   Humanities can change every day and is something that we're constantly redefiningJoyce Yu20100101 Bringing   computing technologies to bear in humanitiesbased modes of inquiry and/or bringing humanitiesbased modes of inquiry to bear in   computing technologiesKathleen Fitzpatrick20100101 Application of computerbased methods for the Humanities Though on some occasions I prefer 'Humanities Computing' to make clearer that these applications often have to be developed and that a lot of basic research is required What I do not like about the term 'DH' is that it implies that there is   humanities as opposed to non  humanities But there is not In the future computerbased methods will be naturally used by any scholar It is not like experimental vs theoretical physicsMalte Rehbein20100101   Humanities is to me really an umbrella term for 1) 'Code Studies'  the name proposed by Mark Marino 2) textual encoding and archival curation 3) public humanities 4) data mining and visualization 5) software engineeringLaura Mandell20100101 I define   Humanities as the natural evolution or extension of traditional academic humanities pursuits specifically through the use of   technologiesMichael J Maguire20100101   humanities is an interdisciplinary often collaborative meeting place where computing addresses the interests and concerns founded in the humanities (and vice versa) At times   humanities is highly applied and at other times theoretical and reflective but always diverse and complexmilena radzikowska20100101 I think of '  Humanities' is a vague and ambiguous term in fact I think it causes a fair amount of confusion both inside and outside of the academy   is an umbrella term that depending on who you are talking to covers a huge territory: everything from applied text analysis and corpus stylistics to the more esoteric and theoretical realms of video game criticismMatthew Jockers20100101 From using computer in another way than a typewriter to large infrastructures for research : I do prefer a large definition to grab all uses of IT linked to literary studies (which is my field) Ideally it covers literary studies as well as electronic/hypermediatic literatureRené Audet20100101 It is the intersection between the humanities and computing science and information technology  It means using computing technologies in humanities work or making modern information technology the subject of humanities research or creating humanitiesfocused technology Note that its rarer to find the second definition actually being done which is really too badSilvia Russell University of Alberta Canada20100101 The   Humanities community continues and extends the traditions initiated within and long held by the conventional humanities teaching and research community but   Humanists adopt computational approaches and technologicallydriven methodologies to address traditional humanities problems and to research respond to and define new types of humanities problems and inquiryStephanie Schlitz20100101  is a research discipline that bridges the gap between engineering and humanities  is not simply about engineering software for humanities scholars Instead  is where disciplines from engineering and humanities combine their expertise in dealing with information per se (And obviously one potential outcome of such a joint research may be tools that can be used in the humanities)Tim Weyrich20100101 Area studies focused on the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) to research and education in the fields of the Arts and Humanities and on the development of computing tools to further that researchStéphane Thibault20100101 Just as man is according to Nietzsche 'the animal whose type is not yet determined' ('das noch nicht festgestellte Tier')   humanities are those kind of humanities who are as yet undefined We cannot yet gauge the full impact of   corpora on the future of scholarly research We can only speculate what the effects will be of the increasingly   nature of scholarly publishing We do not yet grasp the consequences of applying computational methods to 'traditional' disciplines such as History Literature and Theatre Studies My   humanities are fundamentally a playground for experimentationThomas Crombez20100101 For me '  humanities' is 'humanities amid the   capabilities we have'  Most of my programming and scripting is less about consciously defining new   paradigms for humanities research and much more about 'eradicating the boring and repetitive research tasks making my life easier thereby'Tara L Andrews20100101 Using   tools to pursue the traditional concerns of the humanities while simultaneously reflecting on and responding to ways that   tools media and culture are transforming those concernsLewis Ulman20100101   humanities for me is heavily weighted toward the improvement of resources for researching and understanding literature and history I see the   humanities as not only offering tools to offload or streamline traditional research tasks but as a way to gain new knowledge that was not previously possible by helping learners see new connections and resonances Paul Conway speaks of   archives as able to 'transcend originals' and I think of the   humanities as taking a set of knowledge sources already available and creating something new through themAmanda Visconti20100101 Para mí la Informática Humanística es la disciplina científica que permite acercar los estudios humanísticos a la época actual utilizando las herramientas metodologías y medios de difusión nuevo que ha puesto en nuestras manos la informáticaJosé Manuel Lucía Megías20100101 The use of   technology including such tools as computers video cameras and tape recorders at a minimum to forward the traditional work of the humanities: the creation storage and dissemination of critical and creative knowledgeKeith Dorwick20100101 To me the   humanities are about harnessing   technologies and tools in the quest for understanding and sharing human expression and experience At their most fruitful   technologies offer both scholars and a public audience new ways of seeing and understanding our cultural heritage  and new ways of discerning patterns that were not possible (or were prohibitively difficult) with human analysis aloneJustine Richardson20100101 It's the coherent and necessary evolution in Humanities research and disclosure I frankly believe that   media is a new tool that can help us expand our possibilities but it can't and must not replace the traditional methods of gathering and exposing informationCarlos Ariel Páez Martínez20100101 I think that  is a way to approach computer tools and languages from a critical point of view to study and (try to) provide more structured and semantic   contents In a web of data where contents are produced shared and redistributed seamlessly trough different supports and devices (and space and time) this is a crucial issuePaolo Sordi20100101 I like to define it as injecting a little humanity into the machine Bad metaphor?  How about: applying the lens of the social sciences to computing science and using computing methods in humanities research20110101 But really '  Humanities' just makes me think its practitioners are the first scholars to accept their cyborgselvesEric Forcier20100101 I think   Humanities is a kind of 'fastacting glue' that allows scholars with different academic backgrounds to collaborate

a computer screen most of us do both  Should we have codicological humanists then?Peter Robinson20100101 Rather broadly:  humanities teaching and research that makes use of computers and even more importantly internet applications as an integral component of either the teaching or the researchLarry Swain20100101   Humanities is the use of   technologies for the pursuit of a greater understanding of the humanities An example of this would be the use of SQL which is a database language and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to better understand ecclesiastical sites of Medieval IcelandJohn Wall20100101   humanities involves the application of the   to work in the humanities practiced self consciously  encourages the humanist to engage with the technology and not just to

  Humanities is a new term that describes what is probably an old activity (or collection of activities) but which gives us a fresh image or metaphor for that work so that it can be seen with new eyes It allows for new connections to be made across what were previously very separate fields of interest which is the essence of imagination and the creation of new knowledgeSusan Greenberg20100101 Humanist Computing is the application of computational methods and associated tools to address specific humanities research problems Distinct from general computing approaches Humanities Computing is embedded within the research concerns of the disciplines and subfields that make up the humanities The methods employed in the field may be used to uncover new knowledge about corpora or to visualise research data in such a way as to uncover additional insights and meaning Succinctly Humanities Computing is about structuring analysing and communicating humanistic knowledge in a critical and authorial way using computing technologyCraig Bellamy20100101 I define it as the use of dataprocessing technology and techniques applied to the development research reporting and teaching of humanities research questionsDaniel Paul O'Donnell20100101 The   humanities is the use of   methods and technologies in humanities teaching and research Humanities computing by contrast can be reserved for the study and development of those methods and technologiesGeoffrey Rockwell20100101 I'll give the same definition from last year: I broadly define Humanities Computing/  Humanities as a field in which scholars within the humanities use or study computers or a   environment (eg the WWW video games   fiction etc) in their research I consider myself to be a   humanities researcher because I am studying   short fiction and its communities in my thesis but also because I sometimes use social science methods and computing tools (online questionnaires quantitative/qualitative analysis etc) which reflects the interdisciplinary nature of humanities computingSusan Hesemeier20100101   humanities is a field of study characterized by critical analysis of the relationship between the produced surfaces of   media and the information structures and cultural structures that produce them alternatively (or additionally) it is characterized by a critical interest in how humanities scholarship is produced consumed and transformed in and through   mediaJulia Flanders20100101   Humanities is any attempt to incorporate   understandings or culture into scholarship pedagogy and service For my particular reasons I define   Humanities as an attempt to use computing methods to understand 19th Century British literature from a book historians point of view As a teacher I use   Humanities to create a bridge among myself my students and our contemporary culture We use all kinds of tools to get into 19th Century print culture and not just tools to assess the 19th Century moment but to also create content that can serve as a critique of our own use of tools such as Twitter Moodle ClassSpot techenhanced teaching facilities For instance we explore gaming as a way to discuss the technological upheaval of the printing press in the early 1900s That's just a tidbit of my world as a   HumanistKatherine D Harris20100101 for me its the use of computing technologies to allow humanities research that would otherwise prove impossibleMelissa Terras20100101   Humanities refers to efforts to link the humanities disciplines with the everincreasing role of technology in the academy the scholarly community and the life of the mind as it is made manifest throughout our evermore global intellectual community It ranges from undergraduate blogs on energysavings (sponsored by sustainability initiatives at numerous institutions) to rarified reflections on rhetorical analysis via wordcount searches of Lord Byron's journals   knowledgework will define the activity of humanities researchers scholars and teachers in the coming decades  (See also my 2009 definition)Ashton Nichols20100101 My definition has changed a bit from last year I continue to regard the   humanities as a method or set of methods as opposed to a fullblown discipline I subscribe to Unsworth's claim in 'Knowledge Representation' that   methods are interpretive frameworks to place alongside others such as new historicism or deconstruction But I am more sensitive now to the effects that method has on discipline in the first place and how the distinction is not entirely stable I also believe that some curricular space should be devoted to media fluency just as we devote time to writingRafael Alvarado20100101 I prefer the term Humanities Computing as I think ' ' is reductive to the Computing Science portion of the term My definition for that term is: Any project which combines computing problems with humanities methods humanities problems with computing methods or the creation of new objects of study that are somewhere on that continuumMatthew Bouchard20100101  is the use of computing technologies to enhance humanities research and the use of humanities methodologies to enhance computing technologies  It's hallmark is interdisciplinarity   is about recognizing   technologies as yet another tool to assist in humanities research  not the only tool   and also about recognizing that the humanities must play a strong role in shaping   technologies in the futurePaul Youngman20100101 the development study and use of   tools in the arts and humanitiesStephen Woodruff20100101 Using   media to explore create analyse and decode meanings in cultural products current affairs and social lifeAlex Sevigny20100101 I think the beginning of my course description for Humanities Computing may be a start: In 1924 I A Richards began Principles of Literary Criticism by declaring “a book is a machine to think with” As the technology of texts has shifted over the ensuing 85 years our understanding of the bookmachine and how we think about/with it has also evolved In this course we will explore nontraditional modes of literature (aka “New Media”) along with computational methods for analyzing texts We will be working with some of the more advanced aspects of XML XSLT XHTML and CSS  Additionally we will be considering many theoretical works that have an established place in the   Humanities canon   Sara Steger20100101 Modelling and recording traditional humanities data sets in such a way that they can be read by both humans and

they need and to encourage sharing of materials These materials fall mostly into the areas traditionally associated with the humanities The very activity of aggressively growing research in an open environment will doubtless change the definitions and limitations that former labels gave to us and our disciplinesWilliam Allen20090101   Humanities is the marriage of two areas of study heretofore considered incompatible  IT and the humanities   primarily involves the use of IT to gain new insights into the humanities  The keywords are scale navigation and exchange  These tools afford the humanist the ability to analyze large bodies of work on a previously unimagined scale  They also allow for ease of research/data navigation and provide an efficient means of research/data exchange

humanities computing as the field of study that helps to provide insight into the human condition through   technologies  The methods and techniques used in the   humanities can be varied: algorithms for emergent art the application of procedural rhetorics to explore sociocultural issues or the design and analysis of procedures to make computing technologies more humanfriendly  Research methods related to the   humanities can be hermeneutic (eg what are the hidden cultural and social layers within technological practice and what do they tell us about particular discourse communities?) ontological (eg how do I project my own beliefs desires and values onto a personal avatar?) or purely practical (eg how can I digitize this text to make it available and searchable to those audiences who do not have the means or ability to access a physical copy?) Humanities computing and the   humanities are of vital importance as they keep technological systems humancentered leaving room for creativity exploration and playfulness  The famous interdisciplinary German thinker G W Leibniz pursued the dream of the Universal Computer as a means for freeing up the human mind for more creative and enjoyable pursuits although information overload and the increased workload of distributed industries have made this goal quite challenging I feel that the field of   humanities does more to advance this philosophy of creative playfulness and exploration perhaps more than any other area of scholarly studyRudy McDaniel University of Central Florida20090101 For me the   humanities is not a discipline per se but a set of beliefs theories practices methods and artifacts associated with the use of   technologies to support extend and transform traditional humanistic fields  It crosscuts the traditional humanities  I follow Erwin Panofsky's definition of the humanities as those disciplines concerned with interpreting the 'records left by man'  (Sexism not intended)  Among the specific items in the assemblage of artifacts and ideas that currently characterize the field are (1) the use XML in a variety of forms including TEI and serial RDF to encode texts and data and (2) the use of mathematical graph theory as a unifying language for describing texts minds and societies and other organis(m|ation)sRafael Alvarado Dickinson College20090101 Humanist Computing is the application of computational methods and associated tools to address

it is not an established field in German scholarshipKaiChristian Bruhn University of Applied Sciences Mainz20090101 For those us invested in literary studies and bibliophilism   humanities may seem like a contradictory and terrifying set of terms Yet the divide between the humanities and   technologies seems to be increasingly blurred thus rendering '  humanities' a complementary set of terms rather than a contradiction Computing within the humanities is to utilize current computer technologies in the pursuit of literary studies   humanities is the conjoining of different areas of disciplines in order to achieve a richer and more collaborative workspace   humanities signals the move towards interdisciplinary approaches within academia and the larger culture around us Epedagogy social media classrooms   storytelling blogs etc  these are merely some examples in the current trend towards more interactive collaborative and interdisciplinary ways of learning that allows for a blurring of boundaries Paving the way for dialogues to occur across different disciplines   humanities enables a kind of social utopia in which communication happens beyond the classroom and even on a global scale If the humanities concerns itself with the human condition and our place within this world (to put it broadly) it is imperative that humanists address the impact of   technology on their subjects of inquiries As English professor Cathy Davidson claimed in a 2009 Modern Language Association panel this is not the age of   technology: this is the age of humanists and it is our tasks to forge and claim our positions as important thinkers and players within today's '  age'Viola Lasmana San Francisco State University20090101   Humanities: the creation and preservation of extensible   archives to document and tools to interact with material cultureRobert Whalen Northern Michigan University20090101 If you ask to an Italian a Finnish or an American what HC is would you get the same kind of answer? So my first answer is to start questioning the nature of your question I think we need to start to apply the principles of ethnographic research to our field Considering for example the existence of strong cultural differences The universal language of the   machine gave us the wrong impression that we all share the same values methodologies and approaches to the study of cultural objects It is not so and in fact I think there is a huge potential cultural danger in our current obsession with standardization So my second answer would be that humanities computing is a semiotic oxymoron (pessimistic answer) but also a cultural challenge (optimistic option) Sometimes I ask myself: why HC did not do to humanities what cultural studies did to sociology anthropology or philosophy? Think of the profound impact that CS had on their intellectual agendas My answer is that HC lacked an effective and selfconfident cultural vision This happened in my opinion beacause HC until now has been mainly focused on the document culture and consequently has adopted an approach largely dependent on conservative (or if you prefer 'conservation') practices The 'paradigm of conservation' is largely dominant in the international scenario led by historically monolingual and monocultural institutions like TEI which basically tells the community not just how to encode a text but what a text is It has been said by other colleagues that HC is the application of computational methods to humanities research and teaching This definition is correct but I think that future of HC would be not just to use and apply formal methods but to challenge existing discourses cultures and disciplines So perhaps the issue would be not how much computing we need for getting the answers but how much the computer science needs us to ask the right questionsDomenico Fiormonte Università Roma Tre20090101 For me Humanities Computing means the transformation of creative and informative communication (for all individuals not just academics students and other experts) via an ever and expanding array of information and communication technologies an amplification of the individual's power to research to write to communicate to publish and to participate in and create new spaces in the public sphere Just as I feel that the Humanities enrich everyone's life humanities transformed by ICTs enrich everyone's lifeLesley Mary Smith George Mason University20090101 The best way I've found to describe what   Humanities is in first place to myself is using a quote from Thomas Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49: 'You know what a miracle is  another world's intrusion into this one'Federico Meschini De Montfort University20090101 I broadly define Humanities Computing/  Humanities as a field in which scholars within the humanities use or study computers or a   environment (eg the WWW video games etc) in their research  I consider myself to be a   humanities researcher because I am studying   short fiction and its communities in my thesis but also because I sometimes use social science methods and computing tools (online questionnaires quantitative/qualitative analysis etc) which reflects the interdisciplinary nature of humanities computing  Although I am currently completing a PhD in English my MA in Humanities Computing and Comparative Literature from the University of Alberta has helped me to approach my research from a more interdisciplinary perspective something that I see as being an integral part of humanities computing/  humanitiesSusan Hesemeier University of Toronto20090101   humanities studies the intersection and mutual influence of humanities ideas and   methods with the goal of understanding how the use of   technologies and approaches alters the practice and theory of humanities scholarship In this sense it is concerned with studying the emergence of scholarly disciplines and communicative practices at a time when those are in flux under the influence of rapid technological institutional and cultural change As a way of identifying   interests and efforts within traditional humanities fields the term “  humanities” also identifies in a general way any kind of critical engagement with   tools and methods in a humanities context This includes the creation of   editions and   text or image collections and the creation and use of   tools for the investigation and analysis of humanities research materialsJulia Flanders Brown University20090101 I often say that humanities computing involves three distinct research areas First some researchers apply computing to research questions in the humanities These might be questions they've always pursued but can now pursue faster or at a larger scale or they may be questions that could not be addressed satisfactorily at all without computers Second some researchers take computing as an object of study using humanities methods Examples include cyberculture and posthumanism Third some researchers take a generative approach creating new online materials or tools for subsequent study and use Most of my own work is in this third areaStan Ruecker University of Alberta20090101   Humanities to me encompasses any of a multitude of approaches to the arts and humanities that address and embrace the empowering societal shifts afforded by technology    Humanities is about open communication collaboration and expression  It mirrors my own artistic process of A/R/Tograpy in that  incorporates art research and technology  It is about discovery and sharing as much as it is about archival and data visualization  Above all   Humanities is about shedding light on the human experience and ultimately our own interconnectednessJolandaPieta van Arnhem College of

I'm defining  by helping build this site!Dan Jaquint20140101 The exercise of defining   humanities can often leave us with more questions lingering theories and answers that allude to some aspect of the question but which inevitably lead to assertions that perhaps   humanities is open to interpretation Essentially what it is or is not is based on “your” interpretation and perspective as either a practitioner theorist or an observer In its simplest guise   humanities (from my perspective) is the provision and development of technology for the humanities which is itself focused on artifactual

inandofitself but a practice: the use of   tools software and techniques to enhance scholarship in the humanities That being said aside from enhancing traditional modes of scholarship (increasing speed of communication increasing size and availability of databases etc) I think  also offers unique insights that simply cannot be derived from traditional (analog) methods of research and analysis

collect richer datasets during our research document those datasets in such a way that they can be more easily understood and reused by others use   datasets to identify patterns that inform us in new ways about our subject matter and communicate our research and subject knowledge to our students and the general public in innovative interactive and engaging ways In 20140101 I am less convinced by the idea that what I described above is actually a distinct field of inquiry Frankly I think everyone should be doing the things I mentioned  and most scholars these days are already doing at least the first thing (using   tools to collect richer datasets) I'm also a bit put off by the title '  Humanist' or the statement 'I do   Humanities' These seem to me increasingly statements meant to define ingroups and outgroups (and consciously or not to better position the speaker for funding and promotion opportunities) So this year I'm a Humanist who works with   tools I do Humanities  ly So

Nafpaktitis20140101 Using   tools for humanities researchDiane Biunno20140101 Although I embrace the term   humanities I find the need to define   humanities as something separate from or in addition to the humanities at large to be problematic Even though the logic of print still shapes and governs aspects of what we do both as humanists in the academy and our culture at large electronic media have been shaping us and our culture for more than 100 years now and   media for decades The modern humanities having their origins in the fifteenth century were intimately tied to the new technology of the printing press: by the new ways of production transmission organization visualization and thinking that the printing press fostered As humanists in the   age it should be a given for us to fully engage   technologies and the new methods and apparatuses they foster Simply put there should be no need for us to identify ourselves as   humanists But since we do need to do so I define   humanities not as doing the work of traditional humanities with   technologies but as engaging the humanities with the tools available to us and by the logics they foster We explore we interpret and we make Most importantly we understand that all technologies of representation and communication bring with them affordances and constraints and to limit ourselves to the apparatus of one technology of one technological age is to limit what we and what the humanities can beJohn Walter20140101 I see  as a set of resources  software texts tools etc  that contribute building knowldge A network a

humanities questions and dataEthan Watrall20140101  The humanities are undergoing a set of changes which relate to research practices funding structures the role of creative expression infrastructural basis reward systems interdisciplinary sentiment and the emergence of a deeply networked humanities both in relation to knowledge production processes and products An important aspect of this ongoing transformation of the humanities is humanities scholars’ increasing use and exploration of information technology as both a scholastic tool and a cultural object in need of analysis Currently there is a cumulative set of experiences practices and models flourishing in what may be called digital humanities The research presented here explores the scope and direction of this emerging field as well as the role of humanities computing in this enterprise In this article the first in a fourpart series I explore the discursive shift from humanities computing to what is now being termed the digital humanities examining how this naming is related to shifts in institutional disciplinary and social organization Materials such as the Humanist email list journals conference materials principal texts professional blogs and institutional websites provide an important empirical basis for the analysis Academic fields are partly produced represented reinforced changed and negotiated through these modes of discourse As will be evident from the analysis the renaming of humanities computing to digital humanities brings with it a set of epistemic commitments that are not necessarily congruent with a broad and inclusive notion of the digital humanities I suggest that interesting tensions arise from the instrumental textual and methodological focus of humanities computing as well as its relative lack of engagement with the "digital" as a study object In the second article I explore the broader landscape of the digital humanities through a discussion of digital humanities and digital humanists associated traditions personal encounters and importantly through a suggested set of paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology: information technology as a tool an object of study an exploratory laboratory an expressive medium and an activist venuehe third article discusses cyberinfrastructure for the humanities more broadly — and for the digital humanities in particular — in relation to the current discourse of cyberinfrastructure models of implementation and possible directions The article also presents a fairly extensive case study of HUMlab — a digital humanities center at Umeå University Finally tentative advice as to implementing and strategizing humanities cyberinfrastructure is offered In the fourth article I explore the multiple ways in which the digital humanities have been envisioned and how the digital humanities can often become a laboratory and vehicle for thinking about the state and future of the humanities at large Some foundational issues including the role of the humanities and changing knowledge production systems are discussed and related to the development of the digital humanities Furthermore a tentative vision of the digital humanities is presented This vision is grounded in the article series as a whole as well as in the important collaborative possibilities and challenges that lie ahead of us Together these four articles constitute an attempt to outline and critically discuss how the humanities interrelates with information technology in multiple ways to understand the historical conceptual and disciplinary aspects of this interrelation and to present an expansive model for the digital humanities The status of such academic units of course is not normally on the same level as (traditional) departments which tend to be the privileged academic organizational unit In many cases humanities computing units have been seen as service units with a rather instrumental role and representatives find themselves having to present their field in such a way as to maintain financial support as well as their share of integrity and independence Frequently like in the case above academic units which are seen as having a technological service function are susceptible to different kinds of organizational changes and budget cuts For instance the central university administration might question whether the most efficient organizational structure is to have departments and faculties run their own computer support functions or whether it is more efficient to adopt a more centralized model Also humanities computing units that have several functions might have to cut back on the more researchoriented activities because after all technical support is more instrumental (and sellable/buyable) and there might not be enough explicit interest from humanities departments to motivate a more research and methodology focused function There are many examples of changes like these (see [Flanders & Unsworth 2002] for some other examples and a further discussion) Several prominent servicebased units including the Humanities Computing Unit at Oxford University and Centre for Computing in the Humanities at University of Toronto have been closed down (or radically reformed) over time and this vulnerable position is part of the shaping of humanities computing
