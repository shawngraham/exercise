However, I have not heard any dispute over my work being part of , and that work involves computationally analyzing data sets from the field of Slavic linguistics, and de-siloing scholarship in that same field through a collaboratively authored academic wiki.
The building and use of tools for studying the .
The in and for a age
Previously, I defined DH as an umbrella term for something like the use of technology to study human cultures and the study of the effects of technology on human cultures. Today, I would add that DH has (or should have) a self-conscious reflection on the technical aspects of these endeavours, whether that means acquiring and making use of the programming skills to produce new tools for study of human culture, examining the methodological problems of using these tools, or theorising the way their underlying technologies affect human society and the material objects of human culture. That said, I am worried that the theorising of the , the development of infrastructure to support the , and the opportunity of exploiting the big data sphere of the internet are collectively having the effect of marginalising the study of traditional objects of study in the , particularly those of the more distant past.
The is about creating people. Creating people who intersect with and apply the tools and methods of computer science using the principles, values, and techniques of the .
Making stuff, and using it to collaborate and connect with the public.
A community of practice using and critiquing tools to further study.
 (DH) is an umbrella term for a variety of practices, methodologies, and forms of scholarship unified by a mutual interest in the and the . The , ever plural, at once denote a social community, a tactical term, a mode of research, and an object of research.
If you think you are doing it, then you probably are, but the UCLDH definition is: the application of computational methods to research or to cultural heritage; or of research methods to phenomena.
At its simplest, DH is the utilization of computers and computational tools for the exploration, analysis, and production of humanistic knowledge.
You don't.
The intersection between Arts & disciplines and technology. A space where new tools are used and developed, and where new ways of looking at and preforming researching become possible. Most of all, it is fun. Fun because it is challenging, each day, every day.
As I siad on my blog: is the discipline born from the intersection between scholarship and computational technologies. It aims at investigating how methodologies can be used to enhance research in disciplines such a History, Literature, Languages, Art History, Music, Cultural Studies and many others. holds a very strong practical component as it includes the concrete creation of resources for the study of specific disciplines.
 mean, to me, more now than it did back in 2009 when I first did the Day of DH. DH offers a set of tools to pose humanistic inquiry, but it doesn't necessarily offer definitive answers to those questions. Instead it celebrates and records a process of intellectual pursuit that is then distributed and disseminated to the community and abroad. Engaging in is also an ethos: collaboration, building knowledge, sharing projects, screwing around. I apply this to my scholarship as well as my teaching. If my work is better, more complex, because of , so too will my students' work benefit from the tools, state of mind, and ethos.
The practice of combining emerging tools and traditional humanistic study to create new, interactive, integrative, and public ways of disseminating research and discovery.
As the studying and building of research tools for scholarship. For me, this entails trying to offer informed guidance to the historians who want to use research tools (but can't build them) and the developers who can build these research tools (but won't be using them).
DH allows, maybe even forces, me to think differently about teaching. It's a community of learners and thinkers who look at tools as ways to make new tools and knowledge.
 is the critical study of how the technologies and techniques associated with the medium intersect with and alter scholarship and scholarly communication.
Oftener and oftener as one's self-identification with a perceived inflection of study and regard for the world that involves scholarship in environments.
This is my first time participating in the event. I think of as the intersection of computing and the arts.

I view the as a constantly changing field, which escapes easy definition - this is has benefits but also presents challenges! Standard definitions talk about the application of information technology to teaching and research - whether that be to develop better ways of doing things or to create new questions and paradigms - but I think that the field also has a key role in articulating how technology is changing scholarship.
 is the combination of using techniques to better understand and present our understanding of the . It is about the dissemination of our work, the sharing of knowledge and collaborating to give the best possible chance to a project. is about the Community, about learning, constantly evolving and being open to new ways of thinking about old questions. It is not, as a friend asked, about building humans.
I would define as a term used to identify persons, practices, ideologies, etc., that conform to institutional and scholarly values as determined by individual and institutional norms. But I would distinguish the definition of DH from doing work (theoretical, practical, critical), which means something much more. Doing means challenging the institutionalization of humanistic inquiry; in fact, it means responding to the crippling institutionalization of emotive responses to humanistic practices within the public sphere of all â€œknowledge workers.â€ To do this means that we must build tools, technologies, methodologies, and theories that represent this disruptive force, but we must also put what we build into practice. It is not longer enough to present (or represent) an idea, a tool; we must do the work of the community and we must engage the community in developing the ways in which we make our (our as in humanity) work accessible (this means disability studies needs to become a stronger focus of our scholarship and our practices). We must, as Alan Liu argued practice being the service community that we have always wanted to become.
I think I said last year that I dislike that question, and that remains the case. Its boundaries are continually shifting and elude satisfactory definition. Even something as simple as 'Using computers for teaching and research in the ' can have caveats. I recognise why a definition of DH might be desirable, but still: I dislike the question.
Qualitative queries, quantified.
The connections made between humans, text, and images that cannot be made in a strictly analog network.

When quantification meets representation.
The place where technology meets traditional study.
In DH, scholars either try to solve to old problems with new means, in an verifiable way by applying algorithms to given data, or they try to find new questions that couldn't have been asked before with traditional means, e.g. checking a theory against huge amounts of data. DH also implies new presentation of data, methods, and results.

' ' is a gathering term for scholars who embrace technology as a means to explore material as data.
What it really comes down to is what are people doing to contribute to an understanding of the age or what are they doing to expand the practices and work of fields using current technology. A person is not a Humanist by mistake. They are not a Humanist simply because they use a computer to do their work nor are they a Humanist simply by virtue of working in a field and being able to program. What is the methodological framework for their work? For example, using JuXta for collation on a new edition of a novel for the sake of efficiency does not make that edition a DH project, but writing about how the use of JuXta changes the way that we create scholarly editions of literature would fall into the DH field. Essentially, whether or not a person is trying to engage with DH, whether in theory or in practice, determines whether or not they are a Humanist.
It's the sum of a lot of separate activities involving doing research and using computers at more or less the same time, and with at least an intermittent element of methodological reflection.
I think of as an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of work in the : development of multimedia pedagogies and scholarship, designing & building tools, human computer interaction, designing & building archives, etc. DH is interdisciplinary; by necessity it breaks down boundaries between disciplines at the local (e.g., English and history) and global (e.g., and computer sciences) levels.

Building and/or using advanced technologies and methodologies to conduct research in the 
 is a scholarly enterprise which encompasses a field of study, a set of tools, a methodological approach, and a global community, among other things. humanists examine the objects of humanistic study â€“ literature, history, art, language and so forth â€“ using tools to carry out the kind of analysis that would be very difficult or impossible to do without the use of technology. Where the value of lies, however, is not in the powerful capabilities of the tools themselves â€“ as impressive as these may be â€“ but rather in the way that the analyses and visualizations produced by the technology are combined with the skills of critical interpretation, nuanced close analysis, and attentiveness to ambiguity which are born out of a deep grounding in so-called conventional study.
I guess I define DH as twofold : Using technology to do Research and doing research about Technology. Plus a commitment to the openness of knowledge. Plus a commitment to build new scholarly objects.
Making use of the Information Technologies for research.
The ineffably sublime.
DH is multiple. DH is part computing which designs, develops, and/or utilizes computing technologies for research and analysis. DH is also a community interested in collaborative projects and sharing knowledge across disciplines. Still, DH goes beyond the instrumentality of technologies, by critically engaging with questions of knowledge formation, dissemination, and preservation.
By press.
The development, exploration, and evaluation of computer-based technologies and resources for enabling the pursuit of research questions in the .
I have come to think about the as an umbrella term for a few different things. These include the development of tools and software for research, teaching, and scholarship. In this case every part of the development process and use of these tools is potentially DH scholarship. I would also include the use of any tools and software for interpretation and analysis on research questions. Beyond this I would include any work that involves challenging the traditional roles of scholarship and scholarly communication. For example, using blogs to communicate with broader audiences. Lastly, I would suggest that new media studies, that is studies of born objects is inherently a subset of work in the . In short, any situation in which the idea of the touches or engages with work in the .
 
I define as that which lies on the continuum that began in orality, and moved through literate or print-based , resulting in contemporary humanistic endeavors. In other words, I don't see it as a break with all that has come before. That said, however, epistemological shifts characterize the , distinguishing them from earlier iterations.
It's what 'we' do.
The process of acknowledging, interpreting and engaging with the in relation to sources and approaches.
A willingness to engage in new modes of exploring problems using interdisciplinary approaches that may go beyond the comfort level of traditional scholars in your core discipline but that seek truth and understanding with all the rigours of academic research.
In the last 10 years I would have said something along these lines: As an experienced manager and ICT consultant my approach towards DH is practical. For me DH is about interconnecting researchers (and their collections), software developers and infrastructure providers. As a researcher my aim is different. Then DH is about bringing central questions about the nature of the to light. But now I believe is coming of age. And in my opinion has become an intrinsic part of the . Therefore is the same as the .
To my mind, is a two-pronged discipline: 1. Humanists study the ways in which new technologies and new media impact on traditional disciplines, on human interaction, society, and communication. 2. Humanists develop tools and resources for students and scholars to further studies in the and the social sciences, but also to allow for new research questions as new data and tools to examine this data become available.
A fluid term to describe a variety of practices applying and theorizing the intersection of technology and questions.

As a PhD student working in Archaeological Computing, researching the impact of technology on the Cultural Heritage sector, but based within the Electronics and Computer Science department of my university, I see the as a useful definition of the place of my research within an academic context. I see the also as a support network for academics and professionals with a component to their work.
 is a pedagogical and scholarly approach that is both complemented by,'and can exist separately from,'appropriate technological tools. Tools can help scholars and practitioners consider both broad swaths of creative endeavor,'whether textual, visual, acoustic, or otherwise immersive,'and layers of nested and interconnected meanings to develop new ways to engage with an emerging ecology of knowledge.
The application of technology to research and teaching.
Each year that I've been asked this question, it's become harder and harder to answer. My current answer, I think, is that IS the as it is practiced, modeled, and theorized today.
What sits at the intersection of computational method and the traditional pursuits of the .
Cross-disciplinary projects coined by a new generation of humanists as model users, who are asking and creating novel applications and solutions from and with more geeky and technical disciplines, with excellent innovative outcomes, connecting contemporary and fashionable technology with scientific research.
The phrase seems to say it for itself,'something related to the going . That means anything within the realm of the ,'language, history, philosophy, literature, and the arts,'is fair game. In its most basic form, it is still transferring such topics into a medium, but more so for the purpose of uncovering or gaining some new information or perspective on the subject being presented. It could come in the form of visually condensing text in order to both give a general idea of the contents and to provide a quicker delivery of knowledge, or by laying out information in some other visual manner so that patterns can be used to quickly pick up on details that provide certain insight into the subject matter.
DH is what critical theory is or was--an opportunity to ask new questions, try new methods, engage in new conversations.
The practice of undertaking ly informed research and teaching in fields covered by the traditional disciplines.
The convergence between (human and social sciences) and Technologies, either as new methodological and epistemological approaches or as the object of investigations of social, cultural and political concerns.
With some reluctance, as many have said! Well, it's both a field and a suite of methods.
A five ring circus consisting of tech in the classroom, preservation, scholarly communications, new media and computational methods.
The pursuit of knowledge and inquiry in a cluster of subject areas (literatures, languages, linguistics, history, classics, anthropology, archaeology) with the use of some method.
Application of tools to research and pedagogy
DH is the application and the use of computing tecnologies for the research, teaching and investigation in the disciplines of the .

DH is a way of rethinking how work and interact in the age.
Though I think ' ' can mean a wide range of things depending on who's defining it, I define it (usually in lowercase) as an area of study that focuses on the intersection of technology and humanistic research. That's the bare bones of it. But really, in practice (or in Praxis, in my case, as in the Praxis Program at UVa - get it?), DH is a wild, carefree romp through the worlds of coding, design, project management, data analysis, and much more, in order to rethink and reappropriate traditional methodologies of scholarship and research.
While I endorse all the work done under the rubric of , I am actually not a fan of the term. I feel that the term is used to define a political move within academia that is focused on the privileging of certain technologies and technological approaches over the greater epistemological questions that define the and its constituent disciplines. As someone who has to work with people who may be wary of technology in their teaching, research, and publishing practice, I find that insinuating that ' ' is in some way essentially different from general alienates the unfamiliar and more deeply entrenches the already conservative. I believe that an approach that considers the incorporation of these technologies as part of a continuum in the ongoing impact of technology on academic work that predates the and not as a political paradigmatic shift better reminds us that scholarship is centrally focused on the answering of questions about the unknown with whatever tools are at our disposal. The shouldn't really matter in the name and we should think about incorporating this approach to scholarship across all work and not a subset of research. The work is good and important, the term I find more problematic and rarely if ever use to define my work or the work we do at my institution.
To reconsider the methodology of using technology. Thereby, to reconfirm the significance of the .
As a rule, I find definitions rather limiting, However, if pressed (as is the case now), I would say that DH is both about the application of technologies to research and teaching in the , and the self-reflexive critical study of those applications.
 is just one method for conducting humanistic inquiry. Doing research in the often boils down to finding a pattern--in a single text or across several texts--and then providing an interpretation of that pattern. In , computation is used to assist in pattern recognition, pulling out patterns that would be difficult for humans to find unassisted. Interpretation of that pattern, however, remains the most important part of the process.
Using computers to analyse materials and subjects, or the critical contemplation of using technologies for such purposes. Broadly, then, that also means that a good portion of publishing activities can fall within its remit in some form

This new approach can also speed up the process of information retrieval, acting as a supplement to traditional studies and enhancing our overall understanding of the .
The â€œ â€ is an umbrella term that describes how scholars are using tools to inform, approach and present their research and teaching.
Very broadly--any application of the that involves tools and/or approaches.
Bringing tools, objects and techniques to bear on traditional scholarship.
In a recent article on Inside Higher Ed., Steve Kolowich defines ' ' as 'a branch of scholarship that takes the computational rigor that has long undergirded the sciences and applies it to the study of history, language, art and culture.' To this (and other definitions of ), I would add that the must also consider the interface between and analog culture, between the pixels of our computer screens and the printed text of bound books. What we do online has little meaning if it isn't linked (literally or figuratively) to embodied practice. What we are online only exists insofar as it is connected to what we are in the flesh.
 , as I have understood it this semester, is the idea or goal in the process of creating something new. I would define as the idea of integrating and analyzing technical/computational material and create activities with humanistic studies. Basically, it's understanding the material deeper. One activity we did for example this semester was reading the stories of Sherlock Holmes. To understand the story better, with DH we used a tool called the Voyant website. On there, we were able to explore more of the stories depth such as discovering which words are used more than others, also creating charts and graphs and etc.. We were also fortunate to watch the TV series 'Sherlock' to understand the story and actual characters a bit more. Another activity was when reading the novel 'Ms. Dalloway,' which consists of text on paper, with D; we did a mapping project of each of the character's main movements and sightseeing. It made it seem as if we could actually see where they went every day in real life using Google earth. Basically, I would say is the process of going further within the research to find that hidden quality that you couldn't see on the surface and create something new with it.

I define as the engagement and practice of the with and through technologies. This is far from simple, however. technologies change the way we do work. They change the way we compose and revise even when we are writing for print publication. They also afford us new ways to distribute and publish our work and how we can analyze and manipulate information. More radically, however, technologies change the way we organize and perceive the world which leads us to ask new questions and adopt new ideologies. For instance, the rise of open access scholarship, Creative Commons licenses, and remix culture are all breaks from the ideologies of print culture.
 for me is the application of emerging technologies to the study of in an attempt to refine and further develop our understanding of subjects.

DH scholarship is not merely the content of traditional humanistic scholarship translated into new media nor the methods of traditional humanistic scholarship transferred to new content. It is the synthesis of traditional humanistic inquiry and computing technologies by which such inquiry is expanded and deepened in ways it could not have been without that technology.

I conceive in two levels, one as a powerful tool to performed complex analysis, in my particular case, of literary and cultural phenomena. There are a lot tools that can help to unveil relations hidden in huge corpus of information. In the other hand, having the ability to develop those tools and even create objects as such is the other level. are a new paradigm that allows us to embedded different views and possibilities.

Is just plain using tools.
Give me a break. I'm still working on defining but have been using tools in that quest since before DH had a name. Ask me again later.
Using resources, methods and tools to do good transformative research
To me is not adding computing to traditional subjects; it is rethinking our subjects and core activities (teaching, scholarship) as the new communications media take us to new questions, new modes of creativity, and new connections among people and ideas.

In SpecLab (2009), Johanna Drucker explains that the does not simply entail 'the creation of new electronic environments for access to traditional or born- materials. It is the study of ways of thinking differently about how we know what we know, and how the interpretive task of the humanist is redefined in these changed conditions' (xii). What resonates with me about Druckerâ€™s definition is how she conceives of DH both in terms of its epistemological function, and in terms of its function for us as criticsâ€”and I will add to her definition, as teachers as well.
Une pratique rÃ©flexive des outils numÃ©riques en sciences humaines et sociales.

Dare I try such a thing when the debate seems to continue on?! I'm still on the quest to find my personal definition of DH. When I find one, I'll let you know.

 research based on Data and the Internet.
DH stands for a wide variety of disparate practices, methodologies, and ways of communicating that take advantage of technology in order to enable and encourage the act of thinking deeply and critically about life. From this perspective, DH is the name given to the work of the most open-minded and courageous humanists working today.
I think of as an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of work in the : development of multimedia pedagogies and scholarship, designing & building tools, human computer interaction, designing & building archives, etc. DH is interdisciplinary; by necessity it breaks down boundaries between disciplines at the local (e.g., English and history) and global (e.g., and computer sciences) levels.
I see ' ' as an umbrella term for two different but related developments:1) Computing (the specialist use of computing technology to undertake research) and 2) the implications for the of the social revolution created by ubiquitous computing and online access. Since the late Noughties the latter seems to have become the driving force in DH with responsibility for much of the 'boom' in public interest and funding.
A 'community of practice' (to borrow Etienne Wenger's phrase) whereby the learning, construction and sharing of knowledge is undertaken with the application of technologies in a reflexive, theoretically-informed, and collaborative manner.
 is a constantly evolving discipline based on scholarship and pedagogy derived from the intersection of computing and technology with traditional education and field of study.

One of those moments where the rest of the world and collide. is an opportunity for the to explore the immense possibilities that the technologies of today can support (and I tentatively suggest, improve) the way in which identification, collection, interpretation, and dissemination of data happens in our field.
 for me is the way that we can collaborate and share online, all over the world, bringing to life again the old stories while creating new stories of our own, in words and in images.
We use ' ' as an umbrella term for a number of different activities that surround technology and scholarship. Under the rubric, I would include topics like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool development, libraries, data mining, born- preservation, multimedia publication, visualization, GIS, reconstruction, study of the impact of technology on numerous fields, technology for teaching and learning, sustainability models, and many others.

Where the English department surrenders to the Media Arts department under the conditions that they remain in charge of what storytelling means in the 21st century. Hehe. Just kidding. The merging of Literature, Media Arts and other schools of storytelling and criticism into an emergent network that benefits from history but lacks the downside and fixed ideas of entrenched interests be it in the classroom, the boardroom or copyright office. This is an attempt to cast a wider net to include social media and the democratization of media production into the literary cannon complete with thoughtful and insightful analysis and scholarly study and reportage. Literature department walls become osmotic membranes and connecting tissue between liberal arts scholarship in academia, art, technology and social media content producers. DH is a conceptual location where good ideas, best practices and innovation is encouraged. Transdisciplinarity is the new DH Norm. DH is a network aggregate university. While individual universities are slow to change, the networked body consisting of DH individuals from many different universities can combine to evolve an educational ecosystem that thrives on change, embraces technology, plurality and open doors, while benefitting from the support of traditional educational organization.

For me, DH is about creating toolsets that allow users to undertake new forms of research in the . Just as importantly, it's about making sure we build a deeper understanding of what's changing in the wider world as content and interactions become central to our personal and professional endeavours.

I don't. But for the time being I do focus on issues of large-scale connectivity between diverse forms of scholarship and evidence as mediated through the public availability of both.
I view the as a collaborative, open, and emerging field of inquiry. A state of mind, a methodology, and theoretical approach to knowledge, I embrace how it forces us to reconceive our practice. In my own work, I embrace curation, as a means of reweaving and reintegrating theory and practice in history. I seek to interpret space, place, and identity in a multi-sensory way. I fail more often than not. But the is like jazz in that it is about process, as well as out outcome.
My definition of is the creative analysis, synthesis and presentation of information (both print and non-print) in environment. investigate how media affect the disciplines in which they are used. In practice, we are constantly redefining not only the concept of computing but also of computing itself. In this manner, we come to understand how these disciplines when recalibrated for a environment contribute to our knowledge of computing; we also come to understand how computing changes the way we acquire knowledge and experience affect.
 is the application of methodologies and theories to modern technology research.
The use of technologies to support humanists in their scholarship activities. Moreover humanists are expected to contribute to the perfection of existing tools by providing ideas and functional requirements that those tools need to possess.
The use of technology for supporting long term preservation of the human record, and enabling innovative methods for accessing it. The creation of infrastructure to support the work of researchers and scholars in the . It also involves the development of computing approaches to disciplines, mutually enriching and computer scientists. In my opinion, Nicholas Negroponte, (MIT Media Lab co-founder), eloquently captures the scope of DH by stating: Computing is not about computers anymore. It is about living.
Interconnectivity: text, image, space-time.
Production of knowledge in forms not limited to traditional (e.g. pre-electronic) media.
The represents an exciting integration of technology and textual culture. There is an increasing need to recognise the culturally productive synthesis represented in the label ' ' and to understand the immense propensity for inclusivity which results from this union. My understanding of the area, though basic and developing, recognises the need for the universal engagement with the positive possibilities for the increased accessibility of information through the , while also being mindful of the need to preserve the foundations of our .

Quickly evolving interdisciplinary activity that not only transfers to media but also radically extends the potential uses and impacts of texts, cultural objects and other data.
 is the informed and intentional use of objects and practices to create and study in the , broadly defined. In that sense, it is a specialization that cuts across disciplinary boundaries to the work of humanists in other disciplines. It is also the insistence that the comes to understand the implications of its assumption that only print technologies exist, and it is the insistence that the learns that no technology is invisible, natural, or inevitable, and that someday all humanists will be . A few will specialize in print, chirographic or oral-culture .
I think , like social media, is an idea that will increasingly become invisible as new methods and platforms move from being widely used to being ubiquitous. For now, defines the overlap between research and tools. But the are the study of cultural life, and our cultural life will soon be inextricably bound up with media.
For me, 'DH' is an umbrella term for some recent trends in the : amongst others collaborative working and writing, data driven research and visualization. Very often the current discussions on DH are discussions of delimitations and demarcations. One of the main questions is - imho - if DH should be either an integrated part of the or else be some kind of an auxiliary discipline (in the field of History, in German we have the expression 'Historische Hilfswissenschaften').
 involves the effort to consider how our human capabilities and capacities are developing, or being challenged, by and through media. Those scholars and practitioners who locate themselves within view themselves as interdisciplinary collaborators who want to work together to enhance opportunities for individuals and groups traditionally marginalized from the centers of power. We therefore see our task as a critical and productive one, pressing back against the tides of efficiency and busyness that are leading people to view themselves merely as earners and consumers rather than as human creators and participants.
I don't know that defining has any useful purpose, though the act of defining marks with the attribute of scholarly inquiry. A humanist with an interest in things is, I hope, still a humanist, one who defines the self by interest in varieties of human expression. If one's interest is things, then one must achieve some form of literacy to do useful scholarly things. If one's interest is , one must think about how technology reshapes one's interaction with traditional---and new---objects of humanist studies.
I would define it as the intersection between computing technologies and research and teaching in the . Influnced by web technologies, it also promotes collaborative approaches to scholarship.

Creating and applying function to research and pedagogy
 for me is a broad area that contains (1) ICT as a tool for research, teaching and studying and (2) ICT as a subject for research.
I let two very different sources define DH for me: A field of study, research, teaching, and invention concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the . (Wikipedia) and The are just the of the present moment. (Alex Reid: http://www.alex-reid.net/). I find those two definitions - one very inclusive and dry, and the other thought-provoking but equally inclusive - to be productive and useful. To work in DH is to be curious about the intersection of media and research.
 is the application of tools and processes to the study of disciplines resulting in new efficiencies and new discoveries that are not obtainable in the analog world.
A term of tactical convenience.
I try not to.
The advent of technologies is changing and challenging the ways historians practice their craft. The way we collect, present, and store information has changed rapidly in the last twenty years. history is several things: a methodology meant to aid the traditional art and practice of historians, the use of tools to gain insight into information that cannot be done with a legal pad and pen, allows historians to disseminate and present their information in new ways, and a means to reach wide audiences through technologies. The goal isnâ€™t cliometrics 2.0 or to augment the theory-driven social sciences, but to abide by the historian's commitment to complexity and nuance while utilizing technologies to aid that task.
 is , or not -- the study of literature, fine arts, history, language, and philosophy. We don't distinguish sociology or astronomy, so why ? Just because computers are involved doesn't mean the basic nature of the subject area is any different than it has been been traditionally. Computers allow for doing things with texts and other cultural artifacts that could not be done feasibly without the computational power and storage modern computers provide. Computers should be considered an extension of the scholar's mind -- very useful tools indeed.
It is both a methodology and a community.
I define as the next evolution of the College of and Social Science. The root word of is human, and encapsulates all of man in an organic or realm serves a purpose for historians and other researchers.
A delimiting hiatus (an anagram of ' ')
A nome de guerre.
It is the use of technologies to assist people working in the in ways unimaginable to re-discover the meaning of life (!) in this age.
When I'm asked, I like to say that is just one method for doing humanistic inquiry.
The is whatever we make it to be.
The is both a field with a discernable set of academic lineages, practices, and methodologies, and a vague umbrella term used to describe the application of technology to traditional humanistic inquiry. Ultimately, what sets DH apart from many other fields is its methodological commitment to building things as a way of knowing.
something borrowed, something new...
The , quite simply, is doing work with media. Though much has been made about media, like video games, threatening the kind of book learning that humanists do, many of the same critical problems and questions we have been working on for centuries still apply and can be used to read these new media forms. Furthermore, these tools can be leveraged to help us do this kind of intellectual labor. So includes both doing on objects and using objects to do .
DH is all about freedom. Humanity is the producing animal (Marx) or the symbol-using animal (Kenneth Burke). The have always studied what people create in the realm of freedom. The whole point of putting things in the realm is the freedom it gives us, to turn the physical into symbols that we can manipulate as freely as in a video game. You might not find anyone in the academy more concerned with freedom than humanists.
The use of information technology and software with source materials to pursue research questions.
 work is the activity of joining computation and humanistic thinking to create knowledge--interpretations, motivated collections, reasoned arguments, etc.
My idea of DH is that it's sort of like a highway oil slick on a sunny day. When you look at the slick, depending on the angle, you might get a psychedelic kaleidoscope of reflected colours; if you're lucky you might spot your reflection in it; then again, all you might see is darkness. And if you feel compelled to step in it, don't be surprised if you slip. Those stains will not come out.
If someone asks, I refer them to Matthew Kirschenbaum's What is and Whatâ€™s it Doing in English Departments? in the ADE Bulletin (2010). That said, I would emphasize the long tradition of computing, going back to Roberto Busa's work at least---although I'm unsure how precisely it relates to the current frenzy of activity.
 is the intersection of work in the (research, teaching, writing) with technology (tools, networks, interactions), when the practitioner is consciously exploring a humanistic subject and a technological method, at the same time.
 is the integration of sophisticated, empirical techniques utilizing tools and technologies typically associated with practical sciences into the study of traditional questions. It represents a more exploratory and less quantitative approach than social sciences in the use of such tools but it also represents ambitious attempts to model nuanced human wisdom in ways that, like early flying machines, are beautiful, quite impractical and often fail.

 , studies and resources, have the capacity to create social networks. Teachers and curators are able to take collections with them to students in remote locations.
DH combines established research methodologies in the with computational methods and new ways to disseminate ly both data sets and research findings. DH is more a community of practice than a specific set of methods and procedures. Thus, DH encourages ongoing collaboration and its practitioners are committed to making research extensible (or at least they ought to be). DH is by nature interdisciplinary and so provides a practical means to integrate research data and methodologies from more than just one discipline.
 is the deliberate, critical application of emerging technology to the study of traditional subjects such as literature, art, philosophy, and language, often (but not always) with a focus on how those traditional fields are now using emerging technology. We are deliberate and critical when we foreground the study of our own tools (for example, the forward-thinking humanist prefers the open-source tool to the proprietary one). We apply technology because we must participate in culture in order to understand it. Full participation in culture means contributing to (creating) the cultural economy, not simply observing (consuming).
 is the intersection of studies with the world. This intersection just keeps getting bigger, as more people do more things ly, and invent more ways that we can answer questions using computers.
My lawyer advises me not to answer this question. But I have written a few thoughts on my blog. http://www.stanford.edu/~mjockers/cgi-bin/drupal/node/43
DH is a multi-discipline through which criticism, analysis, and speculation is focused on the past, present, and future of the human condition.

Dan Cohen offers a fair definition (http://bit.ly/gVUpV7) with which I wholeheartedly agree. Of course, institutionally, it often makes more sense to describe it as a discipline (when offering a course in DH for example, or in organizing a conference) but I feel that these are rather more like contingent, not essential (if there can be such a thing) characterizations.
Fairly broadly: the use of technology in communicating, discussing, thinking about the .
The is not just technology people and not just traditional humanistic scholars. It should include anyone interested in pedagogy and scholarship with a humanistic ethic. They might work under the hood, behind the technological screen or out front on the stage making it possible to collect and analyze the changing relationships of all agents involved in determining the human condition in the 21st century.
 is the acknowledgement that human creativity is, for the moment, deeply entangled with our technological tools and networks. The media extensions cannot be separated from our reality.
The democratization of knowledge through the application of technologies to the advancement of discourse in the , broadly defined (and not restricted to the academy!).
The use of tools and methods in study and dissemination.
The use of technologies to formulate innovative reseach questions in the and to investigate in new ways the primary materials (text, image, sound. object) with which scholars are concerned. A field of engagement in which technology, textuality and converge.
The is a blanket term for many different types of activities. For researchers, I believe it is a philosophy that there are answers to questions that cannot be answered without the aid of machines. For exhibitors, it is a belief that computers can be used to enhance the visitor experience. For all, it is an understanding that while our own minds may have limits, that need not limit what we can do or know.
the application of information, computing, and communication technologies to questions, problems, or data
 is the application of tools to the work of humanists and the creation of humanist works in the realm. Its applications encompass research and teaching.
For me, it's a number of different things. It might be humanistic research that incorporates tools, the act of building a archive or scholarly edition, finding new ways of displaying research or involving an audience in the research process, or building new tools for humanistic inquiry.
DH is the umbrella that shelters critical hackers and theorists of the hack from the vitriol of analog hacks.
The application of computing and web-based tools in research.
 is, increasingly, just - as far as I'm concerned. New tools lead to new methodologies, new perspectives, and new questions that all humanists should be aware of and concerned with.
I understand DH as the iterative design and application of research and teaching tools to meet the real-world needs of living, breathing humans. This could include students (I'll be working on a pilot writing assessment study that day) or cultural stakeholders (I'll also be working on a long-term project involving the design of a archive for cultural stakeholders).
To borrow someone else's words, it's an intersection of technology and and uses the brains of people across disciplines. DH subsets (text mining, data mining, mashups) can allow scholarship to flourish in ways we never thought possible by adding quantitative value and allowing traditional scholars to find new patterns in their work which they may have otherwise missed.
DH is inquiry enabled by methodologies or modes of research, dissemination, design, preservation, and communication that rely on algorithms, software, and or the internet network for processing data.

Using technologies and tools to ask questions, do research, hypothesize, and analyse, and present human cultural heritage.
The study and practice of using technology for -based research, teaching and collaboration.
At its core, the is the use of tools to gather, organize, analyze, and present scholarly research in the . Humanists seek to understand the world and cultures in which people live and have lived through a variety of disciplines including literature, English and other modern languages, philosophy, art, art history, and history. While many of the questions humanists seek to answer have not changed, new technology, like text mining, dynamic visualizations, and spatial analysis, provide humanists ways to ask new questions and view old questions differently.
The are awesome! We're seeing increased cross-pollination between fields like writing and science, literature and computers, history and engineering. Plus, there are so many new interactive tools that allow us to (re)discover ideas in a new way!
Which is to say, I don't know what it is, but I know it when I see it...
All disciplines that are used to study human knowledge and culture are known as . are all those same subjects conducted by using tools to expand human knowledge and culture. To understand how we expand our knowledge and culture though tools. As an example, Sociology that is classified within , if it studies social behavior, relationships and communications between different users on a network, we could talk about Sociology.
For me explores how and whether we can apply technology to our experience of history, heritage and culture. DH questions how technology changes the environment around us, physical and , and discusses whether those changes are for the better. I believe the concept of is much more then just computing; as society becomes increasingly , it become a way of life and it is important to understand how and why that is happening.
The scholarly study and use of computers and computer culture to illuminate the human record. (BUSA remix)
As mentioned above, to me the key aspects of are the digitisation of materials, and their dissemination to the general public. Work in this field needs to be outward focussed, as much as it is focussed on the furthering of research. The nature of the age is that information can be readily shared, that research can take on a far more collaborative nature, and this approach is of importance to all areas of academic study, including the . Presentation, functionality, and ease of use are, in my opinion, as important as the content of archives in all disciplines.
Innovative uses of tools to do the work of the .
I was a computer programmer long before I was a 'professional' humanist; I think in terms of efficient processes and scalable systems. This has interesting results sometimes when I think about historical research. To me, is most usefully defined as the thing can become when we aren't limited by the ability of a lone mind, or even the ability of a group of human minds alone, to detect patterns and analyze evidence.
For me, but this is very specific, is to interconnect researchers, software developers and infrastructure providers in order to contribute to the research and the research possibilties in this discipline.

The study how media (formats and tools) and the cultural forms associated with them affect the work of the -- and vice versa.
 is the application of computer technology to make intellectual inquiries in the that either could not be made using traditional methods or are made significantly faster and easier with computer technology. It can include both using tools to make these inquiries or developing these tools for others to use.
DH is anything that combines imagining, planning, building, and creating, using a medium, with language, literature, history, philosophy, art, music, etc. Anyone comfortable with a computer and interested in the probably participates in , whether formally (with support from a fellowship or institution, with a planned and mediated project) or informally (through compiling notes and information in multimedia form). We have as much to learn from the informal processes as the formal.
I work in literary studies and archives primarily, so I think about in terms of the interactions between texts of various sorts and a wide array of environments. While my work is focused in this way, I generally conceive of DH as a field interested in the intersections between -based research and teaching and computing technologies and literacies. This would include the which take artistic production as their subject, but also the fine arts and performative practices.

 is a meta-field, a set of co-evolving new knowledge and best practices expanding from traditional disciplines into born- research and teaching methods. humanists study all objects and practices of concern to analog , plus those made possible by the age. humanists also build tools that make it possible for themselves, their students and the world at large to engage critically with our cultural heritage.
I don't define any more. All seems to be in one way or another.
I don't: I'm sick of trying to define it. When forced to, I'll make the referent the people instead of the ideas or methods -- is the thing practiced by people who self-identify as Humanists. It's helpful to have a name for the field chiefly for institutional authority.

 integrates the acquisition of knowledge through research methods, as well as the expression of intellectual material through emergent technologies and media. This is achieved through technologies (i.e. mobile devices, wireless access, and ization), and online platforms (i.e. social media, Web 2.0 applications, and other emergent media). Together these invite a new epistemological way to know and investigate our world.

for me is the filed where the information is delivered in an electronic form to an audience in the field. today the delivery of the information in an electronic form almost has no boundaries. One could easily send a message to one or multiple recipients just from his email account, posting on a blog or simply from his Facebook account (posting a Wall status update). The users around the world are all interconnected together and regardless if one chose to send a message from his yahoo account to an AOL one that is totally possible as now all the separated networks (e.g. AOL, Yahoo) are connected under one umbrella: The Internet. Before, one AOL user was able to send a message just to the members from his network (AOL). Today, the technical developments made possible that everybody could be connected in real time, to anyone else. The information in electronic form can be transmitted not just to those proficient in computing science but also to those interested in modem languages, law, or arts. The capability and easiness of how the information can be transmitted/shared/used, not just between and to computing science related individuals but also to related ones, is the core of the field.
 is to me the use and abuse of technology to potential improve study within the field of . It stretches from a simple blog to complex corpus tools to whatever the next person can think of.
 uses computers, software and the web to enable and publish the ever new work of scholars.
 is the interaction, interrelation, and intersection of technology, culture, language, and literature.
I think it's a convenient label, but fundamentally, I don't believe in it. There are people who haven't yet attempted to come to grips with how tools and methods can change research, teaching, and outreach in the , and these are those who have. The latter are types. But it's all Wissenschaft.

DH fosters the evolution of scholarship, engenders collaboration and dialogue, and widens access and participation across the arts and (and the MLA sector) via the application of methods and techniques.
 is an interdisciplinary area that may include the application of methodologies and research agendas from computer science and other informatics-heavy and quantitative sciences to the subject area of traditional disciplines, such as literature, history and languages.
My definition is an expansive/ecumenical one. I see as an umbrella concept bringing together all of the different ways in which the computer, and especially the internet, have transformed work. It includes using computer methods to mark and analyze analog products, adapting the distinctive features of the World Wide Web for the production and presentation of research, and bringing methods to the evaluation of the entirely new genres of expression made possible by computers.
I am currently using a short definition, which is that is a combination of using computer technologies to study human cultures and studying the effect of computer technologies on human cultures.
 involves the mining of sources, using new media tools, so we can interrogate the past with new questions.
A creative ongoing fest where everybody is invited, but in which only a small bunch of techno people participates!
I hate this question, and I don't have an answer for it. Neither, it seems, does a large portion of the people who might be called Humanists. I'll leave it at that.
For this project we are going for the broadest definition of - the interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the impact and relationship of computing and the . By DH projects we are seeking to document websites, databases, tools, digitilization projects, CDs and so forth that have been created to aid and support research. We are aware that some DH projects can ovelap with libraries or teaching aids and learning objects.
DH mixes computing technologies and new media literacy with traditional fields in , making use of accumulated information. It is a multidisciplinary field, and so very hard to contain within traditional boundaries. Both DH and design are complex playgrounds, maybe that's why designers love to be part of DH projects.
The theorizing, developing and application of/on computational techniques to subjects.
Broadly construed, is the use of media and technology to advance the full range of thought and practice in the , from the creation of scholarly resources, to research on those resources, to the communication of results to colleagues and students.
I define , loosely, as the use of computers and the Internet to advance research, teaching, and scholarly communication in the , as well the study of computing's significance for the . Many activities would fall under this definition, including building tools and collections, using tools and collections to discern patterns in data, communicating the results of research through multimodal and/or interactive publications, linking together classes using social networking technologies, and analyzing the significance of networked culture. I also define by its community and its ethos, which I view as being committed to openness, experimentation, collegiality, transdisciplinarity, public knowledge, and innovation.
The are â€“ or should be â€“ a movement in the that aims to design, develop, promote, and use tools to support work â€“ academic or not â€“ in the various disciplines of the . It strongly encourages, benefits from, and contributes to interdisciplinary practices, including beyond the . I hope that these practices will soon be so natural to the that they wonâ€™t need to be qualified anymore.
I define as a praxis and also as a field, and in this way it reminds me of Romanticism, also a praxis and a field in my opinion. As a practice, DH involves making and/or thinking about objects or entities that participate in or contribute to disciplines. As a field, it perhaps includes the growing body of electronic literary texts (either e-born or book-born) and archival projects as well as theory and criticism related to technologies. I'm sure I'm leaving something out, but this is a start.
Studying what makes us tick using resources
The is what humanists do. What humanists do depends largely on academic discipline but also on level of technical expertise. Each discipline, with varying degrees of intensity, has over the years developed a set of favored methods, tools, and interests that, although shared with other disciplines, remains connected to the discipline. The task of the , as a trans-curricular practice, is to bring these practitioners into communication with each other, and to cultivate a discourse that captures the shared praxis of bringing technologies of representation, computation, and communication to bear on the work of interpretation that defines the .
Humanity (and not just the ) mediated through the largest extant body politic. A global vehicle (and personal prosthetic) for containing what it is to be human and humanist--within and without the academy.
Somewhere between a toolset and a mindset, to do DH is to confront the assumptions and implications of the long analog history of the word.
The intersection of and computer technologies
 : A riddle the humanist has to tackle now if he wants to be a contemporary of his own time. â€” See also: Computer; Conundrum; HumanitÃ©s numÃ©riques.
The practice of the using media.
The era is being born from the change of the support itself in the Human Sciences thought, with the transformation of our relationship to textuality. This turn happens in the context of a crisis in the Human sciences, first a financial crises, but also an institutional and politic one, even if it is softer in Switzerland. In this context, the 'HumanitÃ©s es' â€“ a label diversely interpreted â€“ offer the opportunity to think again our ways of building and transmitting knowledge. The DH are at the same time a practice and a problematic. They include not only the sum total of the technologies applied to the Human sciences, but eminently the questioning on the modifications provoked by these technologies, from the point of view of the training et of the knowledge transmission in the Human sciences.
The development of new methodologies that, combined with traditional methodologies, expands the kinds of research that humanists can do in their own field and in interdisciplinary projects.
For me, the encompasses teaching and scholarship based around a commitment to building. Building doesn't necessarily mean coding. For me, building means understanding and critically analyzing how artifacts (writing, music, film, even houses, arguments, and groups of people) are put together, with the intention of being able to produce something out of the mass of objects and relations that make up our world.
I think is an unfortunate neologism, largely because the itself is a problematic term. The biggest problem is that the tent isn't big enough! I have participated in a number of DH events and they are strikingly similar to things like Science Online.
With that said, DH is at its best when it embraces the not simply as a means to the traditional ends of scholarship, but when it transforms the nature of what humanists do. The allows for scholars, librarians, archivists and curators to engage much more directly with each other and the public. Further, it allows them not simply to write for each other, but to build things for everyone.
 to me is any activity that engages computational media to develop and explore ideas relevant to our understanding of literature and culture.
The performance of related activities in, through and with media.
A methodological approach that uses tools to pursue research in the , and also study of the field of the environment.
An obscure association famously made up of isolated people jointly concerned about the materiality of surrogates, the virtual qualities of physical relationships between avatars, and the creation of their own simulated utopia.
 , at least for me, is an extension of the root Arts and disciplines. My experience tells me that computing and technology has led to many new resources and even more answers to research questions. Crucially, it's allowed the researchers I've worked closely with to ask new, previously unimaginable questions. is a culture, a way of thinking, a new set of methods, and a new set of collaborations.
Good question, to which there is no good answer, but rather just more questions. My own interpretation is quite broad, but there are two ways of seeing DH which interest me - one is generous and encompasses all work combining research and tools and methodology etc, and the other would be rather narrower in definition, reflecting on the specific contribution which 'the ' can make to scholarship and on the 'new scholarship' which develops as a result.
A field of study that looks at the application of technology to the research areas of the . It is not necessarily undertaking that research, but examining the methodology and provision of possibilities for enabling that research or new conceptions of related research. The majority of work in this area, however, gets characterised by those outside the field as IT professionals just doing a bit of programming work for them while uselessly banging on about long-term preservation formats, open data, and not really doing real research.
In a world dominated by technology, DH is an attempt to let humanists catch up with the latest computing advances, understand them, criticize them, and eventually be able to determine their evolution 'from the inside'. In terms of a research program, though, DH is still largely undefined. We are still in the 'understanding and criticizing' phase, with only few people moving towards a truly 'creative' phase. We're pulled by the latest technologies developed within the other computing fields, hardly pushing back into these fields our own research results, for they are often perceived as too simplistic, or not generic enough.
I define the as a methodology and as a field. I don't see it as the logical telos of the computing tradjectory, but rather as a parallel or sucessive movement. The is a beautiful convergence of individuals interested in scholarship, design, born- objects, technology and its impact on society, as well as contemporary history and culture.
 is the synthesis of technical competencies in computing with critical thinking in fields such as history, literary criticism, cultural studies, textual studies, and information management.
A decade ago the comprised academic disciplines that were most easily named by reference to the rules governing the American National Endowment for the . tools have and are breaking down the distinctions among those disciplines as well as between the traditional ' ' and other fields--the arts, for example. tools are encouraging collaborative and open research. tools are forcing us to rethink our definition of academic. tools are re-defining 'scholar.' tools may be pointing the way toward new ways of contemplation and contribution. The is both a force for and a record of the ongoing changes.
The interaction between two world that cannot anymore be considered separately.
One upon a time, a Humanist found a computer and looked around to figure out what s/he could do with it...
 research that examines or implements methods made possible by computers.
Develop web and 2.0 activities for research.
 , to me, is the practice of engaging in issues and discussions pertaining to Computing, and applying -based approaches for examining these issues. Conversely, the same could apply for looking at computing-based issues through a lens.
A new collaborative and social way to analyse, investigate, study and show new research themes related to the , using not only computer and technologies but also the web and all the internet applications available.
The are a diverse area of potential research and inquiry ranging from applying scholarship to computing problems (and vice versa, computing scholarship to problems) to the more cultural and philosophical ideas surrounding our technology influenced world.
 is the utilization of technologies and methods that influence how I practice my craft in the . It is directed by the theories about how we engage in various technologies to learn in the . As a historian, I seek to understand how museums and archives engage with tools and to understand how individuals utilize such tools to learn about the past.
 is a difficult concept to define; for me DH explores how and whether we can apply technology to our experience of history, heritage and culture. DH questions how technology changes the environment around us, physical and , and discusses whether those changes are for the better. I believe the concept of is much more then just computing; as society becomes increasingly , it become a way of life and it is important to understand how and why that is happening.
The convergence of computing and scholarship and practices for the purpose of finding new approaches to the study of a given topic.
Its a rather 'protean' discipline at the moment, I think.

Work that engages with the development of tools or uses these same tools within the traditional scope of .
 involves the use of computers, the internet and related technologies to enable the creation and sharing of scholarship in ways not possible in traditional practice. challenges traditional understandings of the by fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and providing new perspectives on the objects of humanistic inquiry.
 is the deliberate, critical application of emerging technology to the study of traditional subjects such as literature, art, philosophy, and language, often (but not always) with a focus on how those traditional fields are now using emerging technology. We are deliberate and critical when we foreground the study of our own tools (for example, the forward-thinking humanist prefers the open-source tool to the proprietary one). We apply technology because we must participate in culture in order to understand it. Full participation in culture means contributing to (creating) the cultural economy, not simply observing (consuming).
There's no way to divide from its basis just as there was no way of separating the from their previous (still alive) analog medium, the paper. We live, write, read, learn, work, ly, and we create, deliver and use every content ly as well.
Anything that involves production, sharing and co-creation of experience with tools. May also be called local knowledge management.
Using computers to advance scholarship in the .
The most concise way that I've defined computing is: a component for disciplines in the . Computing works towards answering 'yes' to questions in the nature of - is this possible? The definition of can change every day and is something that we're constantly redefining.
Bringing computing technologies to bear in -based modes of inquiry, and/or bringing -based modes of inquiry to bear in computing technologies.
Application of computer-based methods for the . Though, on some occasions, I prefer ' Computing' to make clearer that these applications often have to be developed and that a lot of basic research is required. What I do not like about the term 'DH' is that it implies that there is as opposed to non- . But there is not. In the future, computer-based methods will be naturally used by any scholar. It is not like experimental vs. theoretical physics.
 is to me really an umbrella term for 1) 'Code Studies' -- the name proposed by Mark Marino; 2) textual encoding and archival curation; 3) public ; 4) data mining and visualization; 5) software engineering.
I define as the natural evolution or extension of traditional academic pursuits specifically through the use of technologies.
 is an interdisciplinary, often collaborative meeting place where computing addresses the interests and concerns founded in the (and vice versa). At times, is highly applied and, at other times, theoretical and reflective, but always diverse and complex.
I think of ' ' is a vague and ambiguous term; in fact, I think it causes a fair amount of confusion both inside and outside of the academy. DH is an umbrella term that, depending on who you are talking to, covers a huge territory: everything from applied text analysis and corpus stylistics to the more esoteric and theoretical realms of video game criticism.
From using computer in another way than a typewriter to large infrastructures for research : I do prefer a large definition to grab all uses of IT linked to literary studies (which is my field). Ideally, it covers literary studies as well as electronic/hypermediatic literature.
It is the intersection between the and computing science and information technology. It means using computing technologies in work, or making modern information technology the subject of research, or creating -focused technology. Note that its rarer to find the second definition actually being done, which is really too bad.
The community continues and extends the traditions initiated within and long held by the conventional teaching and research community; but Humanists adopt computational approaches and technologically-driven methodologies to address traditional problems and to research, respond to, and define new types of problems and inquiry.
DH is a research discipline that bridges the gap between engineering and . DH is not simply about engineering software for scholars. Instead, DH is where disciplines from engineering and combine their expertise in dealing with information per se. (And obviously, one potential outcome of such a joint research may be tools that can be used in the .)
Area studies focused on the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) to research and education in the fields of the Arts and , and on the development of computing tools to further that research.
Just as man is, according to Nietzsche, 'the animal whose type is not yet determined' ('das noch nicht festgestellte Tier'), are those kind of who are as yet undefined. We cannot yet gauge the full impact of corpora on the future of scholarly research. We can only speculate what the effects will be of the increasingly nature of scholarly publishing. We do not yet grasp the consequences of applying computational methods to 'traditional' disciplines such as History, Literature, and Theatre Studies. My are fundamentally a playground for experimentation.
For me, ' ' is ' amid the capabilities we have'. Most of my programming and scripting is less about consciously defining new paradigms for research and much more about 'eradicating the boring and repetitive research tasks, making my life easier thereby'.
Using tools to pursue the traditional concerns of the while simultaneously reflecting on and responding to ways that tools, media, and culture are transforming those concerns.
 , for me, is heavily weighted toward the improvement of resources for researching and understanding literature and history. I see the as not only offering tools to offload or streamline traditional research tasks, but as a way to gain new knowledge that was not previously possible by helping learners see new connections and resonances. Paul Conway speaks of archives as able to 'transcend originals', and I think of the as taking a set of knowledge sources already available and creating something new through them.
Para mÃ­ la InformÃ¡tica HumanÃ­stica es la disciplina cientÃ­fica que permite acercar los estudios humanÃ­sticos a la Ã©poca actual, utilizando las herramientas, metodologÃ­as y medios de difusiÃ³n nuevo que ha puesto en nuestras manos la informÃ¡tica.
The use of technology, including such tools as computers, video cameras and tape recorders at a minimum, to forward the traditional work of the : the creation, storage and dissemination of critical and creative knowledge.
To me, the are about harnessing technologies and tools in the quest for understanding and sharing human expression and experience. At their most fruitful, technologies offer both scholars and a public audience new ways of seeing and understanding our cultural heritage and new ways of discerning patterns that were not possible (or were prohibitively difficult) with human analysis alone.
It's the coherent and necessary evolution in research and disclosure. I frankly believe that media is a new tool that can help us expand our possibilities, but it can't and must not replace the traditional methods of gathering and exposing information
I think that DH is a way to approach computer tools and languages from a critical point of view, to study and (try to) provide more structured and semantic contents. In a web of data, where contents are produced, shared and redistributed seamlessly trough different supports and devices (and space and time), this is a crucial issue.
I like to define it as injecting a little humanity into the machine. Bad metaphor? How about: applying the lens of the social sciences to computing science, and using computing methods in research.
But really, ' ' just makes me think its practitioners are the first scholars to accept their cyborg-selves.
I think is a kind of 'fast-acting glue' that allows scholars with different academic backgrounds to collaborate instantly.
Learning and sharing about who we are as human beings, past and present, through media and tools; Helping to develop techniques, tools, and methodologies that benefit the study of the .
I am a non-believer, in this and most things. Some humanists (very few now) only read and write printed books; some (more and more) read and write only on a computer screen; most of us do both. Should we have codicological humanists, then?
Rather broadly: teaching and research that makes use of computers and even more importantly internet applications as an integral component of either the teaching or the research.
 is the use of technologies for the pursuit of a greater understanding of the . An example of this would be the use of SQL, which is a database language, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to better understand ecclesiastical sites of Medieval Iceland.
 involves the application of the to work in the , practiced self consciously. DH encourages the humanist to engage with the technology and not just to consume it. DH is best experienced as both theory and practice.
Studying the impact of technologies on the . Using emerging ICTs to create as well as study cultures and the impact of technologies on cultures and literacy practices.
Using computers to see and model what happens when people express themselves and communicate.
 is a new term that describes what is probably an old activity (or collection of activities) but which gives us a fresh image or metaphor for that work, so that it can be seen with new eyes. It allows for new connections to be made across what were previously very separate fields of interest, which is the essence of imagination and the creation of new knowledge.
Humanist Computing is the application of computational methods and associated tools to address specific research problems. Distinct from general computing approaches, Computing is embedded within the research concerns of the disciplines and sub-fields that make up the . The methods employed in the field may be used to uncover new knowledge about corpora or to visualise research data in such a way as to uncover additional insights and meaning. Succinctly Computing is about structuring, analysing and communicating humanistic knowledge in a critical and authorial way using computing technology.
I define it as the use of dataprocessing technology and techniques applied to the development, research, reporting, and teaching of research questions.
The is the use of methods and technologies in teaching and research. computing, by contrast, can be reserved for the study and development of those methods and technologies.
I'll give the same definition from last year: I broadly define Computing/ as a field in which scholars within the use or study computers or a environment (e.g. the WWW, video games, fiction, etc.) in their research. I consider myself to be a researcher because I am studying short fiction and its communities in my thesis, but also because I sometimes use social science methods and computing tools (online questionnaires, quantitative/qualitative analysis, etc.), which reflects the interdisciplinary nature of computing.
 is a field of study characterized by critical analysis of the relationship between the produced surfaces of media and the information structures and cultural structures that produce them; alternatively (or additionally) it is characterized by a critical interest in how scholarship is produced, consumed, and transformed in and through media.
 is any attempt to incorporate understandings or culture into scholarship, pedagogy and service. For my particular reasons, I define as an attempt to use computing methods to understand 19th Century British literature from a book historians point of view. As a teacher, I use to create a bridge among myself, my students and our contemporary culture. We use all kinds of tools to get into 19th Century print culture, and not just tools to assess the 19th Century moment but to also create content that can serve as a critique of our own use of tools, such as Twitter, Moodle, ClassSpot, tech-enhanced teaching facilities. For instance, we explore gaming as a way to discuss the technological upheaval of the printing press in the early 1900s. That's just a tidbit of my world as a Humanist.
for me, its the use of computing technologies to allow research that would otherwise prove impossible.
 refers to efforts to link the disciplines with the ever-increasing role of technology in the academy, the scholarly community, and the life of the mind as it is made manifest throughout our evermore global intellectual community. It ranges from undergraduate blogs on energy-savings (sponsored by sustainability initiatives at numerous institutions) to rarified reflections on rhetorical analysis, via word-count searches, of Lord Byron's journals. knowledge-work will define the activity of researchers, scholars, and teachers in the coming decades. (See also my 2009 definition)
My definition has changed a bit from last year. I continue to regard the as a method, or set of methods, as opposed to a full-blown discipline. I subscribe to Unsworth's claim in 'Knowledge Representation' that methods are interpretive frameworks to place alongside others, such as new historicism or deconstruction. But I am more sensitive now to the effects that method has on discipline in the first place, and how the distinction is not entirely stable. I also believe that some curricular space should be devoted to media fluency, just as we devote time to writing.
I prefer the term Computing as I think ' ' is reductive to the Computing Science portion of the term. My definition for that term is: Any project which combines computing problems with methods, problems with computing methods, or the creation of new objects of study that are somewhere on that continuum.
DH is the use of computing technologies to enhance research and the use of methodologies to enhance computing technologies. It's hallmark is interdisciplinarity. DH is about recognizing technologies as yet another tool to assist in research - not the only tool - and also about recognizing that the must play a strong role in shaping technologies in the future.

Using media to explore, create, analyse and decode meanings in cultural products, current affairs and social life.
I think the beginning of my course description for Computing may be a start: In 1924, I. A. Richards began Principles of Literary Criticism by declaring, â€œa book is a machine to think with.â€ As the technology of texts has shifted over the ensuing 85 years, our understanding of the book-machine and how we think about/with it has also evolved. In this course, we will explore non-traditional modes of literature (aka â€œNew Mediaâ€) along with computational methods for analyzing texts. We will be working with some of the more advanced aspects of XML, XSLT, XHTML and CSS. Additionally, we will be considering many theoretical works that have an established place in the canon . . .
Modelling and recording traditional data sets in such a way that they can be read by both humans and machines.
DH is that which happens ly in each of the disciplines of the . It is to be distinguished from computing, which is what these separate activities have in common and which takes place at some kind of institutional centre, be it physical or notional.

An ongoing, active, open action to take or develop tools and content that give all scholars access to materials that they need and to encourage sharing of materials. These materials fall mostly into the areas traditionally associated with the . The very activity of aggressively growing research in an open environment will doubtless change the definitions and limitations that former labels gave to us and our disciplines.
 is the marriage of two areas of study heretofore considered incompatible - IT and the . DH primarily involves the use of IT to gain new insights into the . The keywords are scale, navigation, and exchange. These tools afford the humanist the ability to analyze large bodies of work on a previously unimagined scale. They also allow for ease of research/data navigation and provide an efficient means of research/data exchange. Secondarily, DH involves an analysis of the humanistic implications of information technology.
 attempts to bring humanistic inquiry and the artifacts of human experience into useful dialogue with technology. It is, at once, a practical and a philosophical endeavor: a matter of building and of theorizing the built. Practitioners are as likely to be adept at Java as they are post-structuralism; as drawn to the iPhone as they are to Moby Dick; as committed to a kind of optimistic futurism as they are deeply skeptical of a posthuman condition. is also one of most exciting fields in the today, with a burgeoning community of enthusiasts ranging from undergraduate students to senior scholars.

I define computing as the field of study that helps to provide insight into the human condition through technologies. The methods and techniques used in the can be varied: algorithms for emergent art, the application of procedural rhetorics to explore sociocultural issues, or the design and analysis of procedures to make computing technologies more human-friendly. Research methods related to the can be hermeneutic (e.g., what are the hidden cultural and social layers within technological practice, and what do they tell us about particular discourse communities?), ontological (e.g., how do I project my own beliefs, desires, and values onto a personal avatar?), or purely practical (e.g., how can I digitize this text to make it available and searchable to those audiences who do not have the means or ability to access a physical copy?) computing and the are of vital importance as they keep technological systems human-centered, leaving room for creativity, exploration, and playfulness. The famous interdisciplinary German thinker G. W. Leibniz pursued the dream of the Universal Computer as a means for freeing up the human mind for more creative and enjoyable pursuits; although information overload and the increased workload of distributed industries have made this goal quite challenging, I feel that the field of does more to advance this philosophy of creative playfulness and exploration perhaps more than any other area of scholarly study.
For me, the is not a discipline per se, but a set of beliefs, theories, practices, methods, and artifacts associated with the use of technologies to support, extend, and transform traditional humanistic fields. It cross-cuts the traditional . I follow Erwin Panofsky's definition of the as those disciplines concerned with interpreting the 'records left by man.' (Sexism not intended.) Among the specific items in the assemblage of artifacts and ideas that currently characterize the field are (1) the use XML in a variety of forms, including TEI and serial RDF, to encode texts and data, and (2) the use of mathematical graph theory as a unifying language for describing texts, minds, and societies, and other organis(m|ation)s.
Humanist Computing is the application of computational methods and associated tools to address specific research problems. Distinct from general computing approaches, Computing is embedded within the research concerns of the disciplines and sub-fields that make up the .

Succinctly Computing is about structuring, analysing and communicating humanistic knowledge in a critical and authorial way using computing technology.
 , from my perspective as an educator, has to do with helping students use the skills they have (and are learning) as writers and critical thinkers to compose and critique multi-media works in both academia and their daily lives.
Creating, documenting, deploying and supporting software used in teaching and research; digitization, archiving and publication of texts through electronic means; using tools to generate and answer research questions related to texts; collaborating on projects through means; etc. etc...
' ' is a misnomer: there nothing to essentially distinguish it from the disciplines of Arts and Letters as practised for centuries. Just as scientists who utilise grid-computing are not ' scientists' but still 'scientists', and fiction authors who publish in hypertext are not ' novelists', those working in Arts and Letters who use and generate materials and tools remain 'humanists'.
Applying spatial information technologies in the field of archaeology is my main subject. But as archaeological data are 'weak', i.e. might have multiple meanings in different contexts, I'm trying to follow up developments in as a whole. Especially as it is not an established field in German scholarship.
For those us invested in literary studies and bibliophilism, may seem like a contradictory and terrifying set of terms. Yet, the divide between the and technologies seems to be increasingly blurred, thus rendering ' ' a complementary set of terms rather than a contradiction. Computing within the is to utilize current computer technologies in the pursuit of literary studies. is the conjoining of different areas of disciplines in order to achieve a richer and more collaborative workspace; signals the move towards interdisciplinary approaches within academia and the larger culture around us. E-pedagogy, social media classrooms, storytelling, blogs, etc. -- these are merely some examples in the current trend towards more interactive, collaborative, and interdisciplinary ways of learning that allows for a blurring of boundaries. Paving the way for dialogues to occur across different disciplines, enables a kind of social utopia in which communication happens beyond the classroom, and even on a global scale. If the concerns itself with the human condition and our place within this world (to put it broadly), it is imperative that humanists address the impact of technology on their subjects of inquiries. As English professor Cathy Davidson claimed in a 2009 Modern Language Association panel, this is not the age of technology: this is the age of humanists, and it is our tasks to forge and claim our positions as important thinkers and players within today's ' age.'
 : the creation and preservation of extensible archives to document, and tools to interact with, material culture.
If you ask to an Italian, a Finnish or an American what HC is, would you get the same kind of answer? So my first answer is to start questioning the nature of your question. I think we need to start to apply the principles of ethnographic research to our field. Considering, for example, the existence of strong cultural differences. The universal language of the machine gave us the wrong impression that we all share the same values, methodologies, and approaches to the study of cultural objects. It is not so, and in fact I think there is a huge potential cultural danger in our current obsession with standardization. So my second answer would be that computing is a semiotic oxymoron (pessimistic answer), but also a cultural challenge (optimistic option). Sometimes I ask myself: why HC did not do to what cultural studies did to sociology, anthropology, or philosophy? Think of the profound impact that CS had on their intellectual agendas. My answer is that HC lacked an effective and self-confident cultural vision. This happened, in my opinion, beacause HC until now has been mainly focused on the document culture, and consequently has adopted an approach largely dependent on conservative (or if you prefer 'conservation') practices. The 'paradigm of conservation' is largely dominant in the international scenario, led by historically monolingual and monocultural institutions like TEI, which basically tells the community not just how to encode a text, but what a text is. It has been said by other colleagues that HC is the application of computational methods to research and teaching. This definition is correct, but I think that future of HC would be not just to use and apply formal methods, but to challenge existing discourses, cultures and disciplines. So perhaps the issue would be not how much computing we need for getting the answers, but how much the computer science needs us to ask the right questions.
For me, Computing means the transformation of creative and informative communication (for all individuals, not just academics, students and other experts) via an ever- and expanding array of information and communication technologies, an amplification of the individual's power to research, to write, to communicate, to publish and to participate in, and create new spaces in, the public sphere. Just as I feel that the enrich everyone's life, transformed by ICTs enrich everyone's life.
The best way I've found to describe what is, in first place to myself, is using a quote from Thomas Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49: 'You know what a miracle is ... another world's intrusion into this one'
I broadly define Computing/ as a field in which scholars within the use or study computers or a environment (e.g. the WWW, video games, etc.) in their research. I consider myself to be a researcher because I am studying short fiction and its communities in my thesis, but also because I sometimes use social science methods and computing tools (online questionnaires, quantitative/qualitative analysis, etc.), which reflects the interdisciplinary nature of computing. Although I am currently completing a Ph.D. in English, my M.A. in Computing and Comparative Literature from the University of Alberta has helped me to approach my research from a more interdisciplinary perspective-- something that I see as being an integral part of computing/ .
 studies the intersection and mutual influence of ideas and methods, with the goal of understanding how the use of technologies and approaches alters the practice and theory of scholarship. In this sense it is concerned with studying the emergence of scholarly disciplines and communicative practices at a time when those are in flux, under the influence of rapid technological, institutional and cultural change. As a way of identifying interests and efforts within traditional fields, the term â€œ â€ also identifies, in a general way, any kind of critical engagement with tools and methods in a context. This includes the creation of editions and text or image collections, and the creation and use of tools for the investigation and analysis of research materials.
I often say that computing involves three distinct research areas. First, some researchers apply computing to research questions in the . These might be questions they've always pursued but can now pursue faster or at a larger scale, or they may be questions that could not be addressed satisfactorily at all without computers. Second, some researchers take computing as an object of study using methods. Examples include cyberculture and posthumanism. Third, some researchers take a generative approach, creating new online materials or tools for subsequent study and use. Most of my own work is in this third area.

It mirrors my own artistic process of A/R/Tograpy, in that DH incorporates art, research and technology. It is about discovery and sharing as much as it is about archival and data visualization. Above all, is about shedding light on the human experience and ultimately our own interconnectedness.

I'm defining DH by helping build this site!
The exercise of defining can often leave us with more questions, lingering theories and answers that allude to some aspect of the question but which inevitably lead to assertions that perhaps, , is open to interpretation. Essentially, what it is or is not is based on â€œyourâ€ interpretation and perspective as either a practitioner, theorist or an observer. In its simplest guise, (from my perspective) is the provision and development of technology for the , which is itself focused on artifactual evidence to theorise and explore human culture, thought and society.

For our community college students, we focus on the intersection of technology and culture and the humanistic and historical context in which this intersection is situated.
"For me, the easiest way to define DH is not (necessarily) a discipline in-and-of-itself, but a practice: the use of tools, software and techniques to enhance scholarship in the . That being said, aside from enhancing traditional modes of scholarship (increasing speed of communication, increasing size and availability of databases, etc.), I think DH also offers unique insights that simply cannot be derived from traditional (analog) methods of research and analysis.
However, what ultimately makes DH unique from the traditional , is its insistence on interdisciplinary collaboration, unique methods of scholarship, and mediums of study that are 'born- '."

I see DH as an emerging interdisciplinary field of study where technologies are incorporated (as method and/or topic) into research practice.

Teaching, research, and outreach activities taking place wherever and technologies intersect.
Incorporating technology and tools into the field of research to discover and document new contexts and relationships
"For the Day of DH 2013, I defined as the use of tools to do all of the following: collect richer datasets during our research; document those datasets in such a way that they can be more easily understood and reused by others; use datasets to identify patterns that inform us in new ways about our subject matter; and communicate our research and subject knowledge to our students and the general public in innovative, interactive, and engaging ways.
In 2014-01-01 I am less convinced by the idea that what I described above is actually a distinct field of inquiry. Frankly, I think everyone should be doing the things I mentioned -- and most scholars these days are already doing at least the first thing (using tools to collect richer datasets). I'm also a bit put off by the title ' Humanist' or the statement 'I do '. These seem to me increasingly statements meant to define in-groups and out-groups (and, consciously or not, to better position the speaker for funding and promotion opportunities). So this year, I'm a Humanist who works with tools. I do , ly. So should you."
DH is a cover term for a wide variety of activities that attempt to explore and expand areas of knowledge typically examined in the by developing and/or applying computational tools or methods in ways best suited for these areas. DH is also a cover term for a supporting community of practitioners who share a common interest in the tools and methods--and challenges--generated by the activities DH scholars, as well as potentially useful activities in fields outside the traditional .
Leveraging technology/computing to further scholarship in the and to facilitate collaboration amongst scholars, including opportunities for faculty and students to conduct research together.

The use of technology to make teaching, research, and learning better, whether through new tools and ways of asking questions, or innovative new forms of scholarly presentation and communication.
"My stock curmudgeon answer:
 is , or not -- the study of literature, fine arts, history, language, and philosophy. We don't distinguish sociology or astronomy, so why ? Just because computers are involved doesn't mean the basic nature of the subject area is any different than it has been been traditionally. Computers allow for doing things with texts and other cultural artifacts that could not be done feasibly without the computational power and storage modern computers provide. Computers should be considered an extension of the scholar's mind -- very useful tools indeed."

"Although I embrace the term , I find the need to define as something separate from or in addition to the at large to be problematic. Even though the logic of print still shapes and governs aspects of what we do, both as humanists in the academy and our culture at large, electronic media have been shaping us and our culture for more than 100 years now and media for decades. The modern , having their origins in the fifteenth century, were intimately tied to the new technology of the printing press: by the new ways of production, transmission, organization, visualization, and thinking that the printing press fostered. As humanists in the age, it should be a given for us to fully engage technologies and the new methods and apparatuses they foster. Simply put, there should be no need for us to identify ourselves as humanists.
But since we do need to do so, I define not as doing the work of traditional with technologies but as engaging the with the tools available to us and by the logics they foster. We explore, we interpret, and we make. Most importantly, we understand that all technologies of representation and communication bring with them affordances and constraints, and to limit ourselves to the apparatus of one technology, of one technological age, is to limit what we and what the can be."
I see DH as a set of resources -- software, texts, tools, etc. -- that contribute building knowldge. A network, a crossroad, a bridge, a meeting point.
DH is work which uses/engages/builds with tools and possibilities.
For me, the is more than just an area of study, it is a methodology, a means of approaching our work and our interests. While simultaneously embracing and questioning the technology that surrounds us, we also commit ourselves to a willingness to explore, create, play, and most importantly, collaborate.
Doing research with materials and tools in a collaborative and open fashion. Not everyone needs to be a builder, though working with someone who can helps!

DH is a big and probably over-stuffed box that holds an increasingly disparate menagerie of projects, processes, methods and positions that somehow manage to involve humanistic questions and technology (both broadly defined). At its best, it can be the most open-minded and egalitarian place in the . At its worst, it can be, well, frustrating. It is practiced by some of the best folks I know and dismissed by some of the other best folks I know.

It's a hydra--one could define DH as using tools and methods for research, as taking the as object of study, as the study of networks and communication. Often with an emphasis on building, making, doing.

A humanist, then, is not necessarily one who seeks to deliberately engage with a interface, but anyone who uses technology to bring new forms of analysis to bear on humanist subjects.
DH is where the traditional fields of the meet the technological advances, and increased accessibility, made possible by computers. It enables researchers to combine traditional methods with the processing power of computers.
To me, is about exploring the ways in which the affordances of technology can help us explore the deeper concerns of the , from expanding archival access to thinking about what it means to read something. DH embodies a spirit of collaboration, experimentation, and play, in which failure is acceptable and part of the normal process, and in which the action of 'making' is as valued as the action of thinking.
DH is the application of and computational methods, often data-intensive, to the traditional concerns of the . These new methodologies and tools are not ends in themselves, but rather means of asking old questions in new ways, identifying new questions, and introducing new questions to the field that can only be asked through collaboration both among individual scholars and between scholars and software applications.

DH is the field in which and Information Technologies can interact and support each other. On one side Humanistic competences can help Human Language Technologies to tackle one of the most difficult challenges of the discipline, which is the handling of the semantics of human language texts.

For me, as a historian, it is learning new things through technology that we couldn't learn otherwise. Secondly, I think of it as playing and exploring new methods of scholarly communication - i.e. putting history online.

Peering further into the shadows
It's using technology for research, teaching, and publication.
That's a tough one. I think Matthew Gold et al defined it very well as did the ubiquitous Hayles. , for me, brings the to the forefront. Just speaking for my own discipline, English, we bring an ability to read closely and analyze language and its uses. We read texts of all kinds as performing cultural work and, in turn, we suggest or even produce new ways of thinking about those texts. allows us to use a vast set of critical tools to analyze and create ways of being in the realm.
 is the use of computational tools or approaches to find patterns in humanistic production, when those patterns are then used for interpretive purpose.
DH, for me at least, is more about the than about the . While the pervading (and online) structure has some part in change, it's from culture - and shock of differing cultures - that such changes are truly born. So, DH is pretty much a way to explore the role played by the within a much larger context, as well as an exploration on how to use the same to further understand the intricacies of culture.

It's a very big umbrella that covers everything from mapping to data-mining, aggregators to online exhibitions.

On one level, is about applying computational methods to questions and problems that have traditionally interested scholars in the . Computational analysis can make it possible to tease out patterns or relationships that are difficult, or impossible, for humans to detect. The purview of the extends beyond methodology, however.

These inquiries bleed into considerations of mediation more generally, and of the transformative impacts of the turn, particularly of new modes of representation, publication, collaboration, dissemination, networking, and expression, on culture and society.
Last year, I simply said 'DH is inquiry using computational methods' but this year I should expand that definition, borrowing from Matt Gold: DH is at the intersection of traditional and computing, and brings the two together through a methodological commitment to making as a way of knowing.
DH includes 3 aspects: using materials, tools, and methods in the ; developing materials, tools, and methods for use in the ; and subjecting the to study.

For me, DH is the multiple ways that scholarship intersects with computing. This ranges from developing prototypes to engaging in collaborative annotation practices to studying new media trends, and, of course, much more. The most exciting bits (& bytes!) are the unexpected ones.
 is a discipline that promotes hands on experience as an important way of learning. humanists also work towards creating online editions of texts are more accessible, and so that full texts, portions of texts, or a combinations of texts can be analyzed.

"DH, as I would frame it now, is any research work within the disciplines we call 'the ' that treats ly instantiated objects or could not exist (or be conceptualized) without tools. The in DH is as much about the mindset as it is about the mechanisms.
I'm a bit more reticent to define 'the ' so please forgive that intentional oversight."
How do I define DH? Reluctantly.
Using tools to explore, investigate, and interpret the human condition through time and space.

The is the imagined community of a diaspora of humanists whom, having been displaced by the great neoliberal and technocratic transformation of education, have sought to reclaim the homeland of academia by joining the revolutionary, if ambivalent, power of technology to the ancient labors of cultural interpretation, historical consciousness, and aesthetic education.
var DH = Multi[disciplinar, cultural] + [Serendipity,fun] + academic research;
I've always liked the Stanford Center definition of : 'the study of how people process and document the human experience. Since humans have been able, we have used philosophy, literature, religion, art, music, history and language to understand and record our world. . . Knowledge of these records of human experience gives us the opportunity to feel a sense of connection to those who have come before us, as well as to our contemporaries.' I think this works for too.
"The ultimate conundrum...
For me, there are three types of DH practitioner: the researcher who actively uses techniques as an integral part of their praxis, the specialist tool user (e.g. GIS specialist) and the DH tool creator. In that context, it's difficult to define DH as it can be radically different depending on the person engaging with it.
Having said all that, in my opinion to be truly at the cutting edge of DH, you need to be thinking philosophically about how praxis is fundamentally (if at all) different to its alternative(s)."
As our collective attention to and practices in the remediation of scholarly materials, methods, and communications.
To borrow a phrase from someone else: reluctantly.
DH is participating in the world while being attentive to technologies and their implications for human beings.
By getting on with it.
A state of mind? A new approach? A set of methodologies? An academic subject? â€“ IÂ´m not able to give a proper definition, since it is what people make of it. But at least I think (and hope) the following adjectives apply to DH: inquiring â€“ transparent â€“ reconsidering â€“ collaborative â€“ multidisciplinary â€“ receptive
HyperStudio explores the potential of new media technologies for the enhancement of education and research in the . Our work focuses on questions about the integration of technology into curricula within the broader context of scholarly inquiry and pedagogical practice.
Reluctantly, DH describes a collection of activities that bring together humanistic and approaches to learning, knowing, exploring, sharing, and publishing.
For me, DH is using technology to support humanistic inquiry.
Any study that either focuses (self reflexively) on the ity of its subject, or any field of that's study is enhanced through tools and methods.
I view DH as an interdisciplinary form of research which integrates technology with scholarship. As a librarian, I see opportunities for facilitating the use of technology and data within the diverse work of scholars.
 research that uses computational methodologies from a variety of fields.
I view DH as ly-enabled knowledges, techniques and approaches that may, under certain conditions, permit the creation and leveraging of a very particular space. In particular, DH may facilitate possibilities that exist in environments resultant from the convergence of technologies in synergistic, human-centered, and project-based rubrics. Critical understandings related to this paradigm may include disassociation from any one particular tool and/or series of objects, the flexibility to merge and combine tools and conceptual frameworks to fit particular goals and/or participants, and the willingness to blend and combine legacy technologies with techniques not yet created. Throughout- a focus on mixing methodologies as well as tools, approaching DH with a spirit of training, and beginning every project with the pedagogical generosity to teach as well as learn- may serve to catalyze rich creation and the innovation that can result in creative and conceptual breakthroughs.
21st-century research, teaching, and life.
To me DH is a methodology that allows humanists to expand access to their work, rethink their own scholarship as well as those of others, and create greater collegiality, and consequently greater findings, through collaboration.
The intersection of computer technology and questions about the meaning of the human condition
DH is using technology to pursue humanistic inquiry and using humanist methods to critique technology.

DH is the use of tools and methods to transform the way we can view and access research.
DH in a narrower sense is a discipline in its own right. It is a metadiscipline to the . DH in a wider sense regards the transformation of the disciplines within the and thus takes place within these disciplines as well.
Why define it? Just do it!
I define DH by my use of it. As I engage with DH, I am looking for ways to effectively communicate scholarly knowledge with a broader audience; not just as a way of outreach or dissemination, but as laying the foundation for the democratization of knowledge and incorporation of multivocality into scholarly work. Thus, a set of tools for effective engagement.
Through my research and practice, I define DH as both the use and study of technologies.
DH merges the practices, styles and systems from â€˜traditionalâ€™ fields (e.g. history, philosophy, english, etc.) with the computer programmes/tools (such as data/text mining, data visualisation, etc.) to a) answer research questions; b) challenge existing theories; or c) create new/novel questions not before considered, ultimately to bring a new approach to research.
I mostly try not to, but if pressed, I'd say that DH covers both methods applied to the and the application of methods and theories from the to the .
Materials relating to heritage which are created or transcribed into a media. Includes material which is directly born from the platform, but is also surrogate from other analogue forms.
DH involves the creation and application of new tools, technologies, and methodologies within the , as well as theorising about their effects.

I define it pretty broadly--using technology to increase understanding of subjects.
DH is to take advantage of resources to improve our work as philologists.
From Methods to Made ( Manifesto)
I stick by my 2011 definition: The is both an evolving field with a discernable set of academic lineages, practices, and methodologies and a vague umbrella term used to describe the application of technology to traditional humanistic inquiry. Ultimately, what sets DH apart from many other fields is its methodological commitment to building things as a way of knowing.
I refer them to the What is website. http://whatis .com/
Anything and humanistic
 is the application of technology to research. The best projects contribute something to scholarship that could not have been conveyed as well or at all via traditional publishing such as print monographs and journals. Hopefully the term ' ' will be dropped as projects that integrate technology become part of the norm.
I try not to.
To borrow from Matthew Gold, 'building things as a way of knowing.'
It is a field of reasearch in that involves technology as a very important part of its methodology, since it allows creative and innovative uses.
Technically I am an anthropologist, not a humanist. But I would say to me, Anthropology (if that is even a thing!) is the use of methods to study culture and/or the use of anthropological methods to study cultures. My favorite part of DH? Data visualization, social media network analysis (Instagram and Twitter) and educational technology.

I know it's a huge field, expanding in many directions. But for my purposes, it's mainly doing corpus linguistics work with literary texts, and I'm just beginning to play in this field.
It is an emergent field in the that utilizes computing technology as the medium for research, teaching, and service.
dh puts tools to work in order to gain new insights into humanistic subjects. this takes many forms and changes the way we work.
A study of areas typically under the umbrella of 'the ' using methods to advance the research. A looping back into a consideration of these methods and how they may influence the research; the gathering and dissemination of information, the nature of 'information' itself, the tools available to us, the reception and use of these tools, the collaboration necessitated and made possible by these tools leading to a different landscape for academic work.
Erm, still working on that one!

DH is the study, exploration, and preservation of, as well as education about human cultures, events, languages, people, and material production in the past and present in a environment through the creation and use of dynamic tools to visualize and analyze data, share and annotate primary sources, discuss and publish findings, collaborate on research and teaching, for scholars, students, and the general public.
The creative application of technology to questions and data
The are undergoing a set of changes which relate to research practices, funding structures, the role of creative expression, infrastructural basis, reward systems, interdisciplinary sentiment and the emergence of a deeply networked both in relation to knowledge production processes and products. An important aspect of this ongoing transformation of the is scholars’ increasing use and exploration of information technology as both a scholastic tool and a cultural object in need of analysis. Currently, there is a cumulative set of experiences, practices and models flourishing in what may be called . The research presented here explores the scope and direction of this emerging field as well as the role of computing in this enterprise.
I explore the discursive shift from computing to what is now being termed the , examining how this naming is related to shifts in institutional, disciplinary, and social organization. Materials such as the Humanist email list, journals, conference materials, principal texts, professional blogs and institutional websites provide an important empirical basis for the analysis. Academic fields are partly produced, represented, reinforced, changed and negotiated through these modes of discourse. As will be evident from the analysis, the renaming of computing to brings with it a set of epistemic commitments that are not necessarily congruent with a broad and inclusive notion of the . I suggest that interesting tensions arise from the instrumental, textual and methodological focus of computing as well as its relative lack of engagement with the " " as a study object.
There is nothing wrong with a textual focus, of course, but it does have effects on the scope and penetration of computing. The so-called "visual turn" [19] or research on multimodal representation does not seem to have had a large impact on computing. One reason is probably because there is little interaction between these communities and because it is difficult to conceptualize and develop tools for these kinds of framework. More generally, there seems to be an increasing interest in non-textual and mixed media in the and elsewhere (see for instance research on remediation, trans- or crossmedia texts, art and the current interest in "mashups"). And, needless to say, most native media are not pure text while computing through focusing on text in its ized and encoded form could be said to privilege a rather "pure" (if annotated and structured) form of text. It seems that there should be considerable opportunities in this area for computing – both for innovative tools and thinking – but also in relation to making a strong case for the need for considerable cyberinfrastructure in the .[20] Furthermore, there is clearly a need for people with expert competence and interest in structuring, annotating and managing data. It is exciting to see that interest in non-textual representation and analysis seems to be growing in computing. It seems worthwhile to support this development – at least if the vision is an expansive and inclusive computing/ . Such a development would not have to preclude a retained textual focus, of course.
Georgia Tech and traditional computing clearly represent very different approaches to . For example, while Balsamo sees information technology as a cultural object in need of exploration and epistemological critique, traditional computing treats technology in a more formal and instrumental way. In the next article in this series, an attempt to lay out a more detailed and comprehensive map of the will be made. A number of diverse initiatives and approaches are used as examples, and different modes of engagement with the " " are discussed at more length. The story of the continues to be complex in terms of the theoretical, practice-based, historical, technical and disciplinary foundations and a fast-changing landscape. It is exactly these qualities that make an exciting field to study, and a place full of energy and multiple identities
